## Concept

The main purpose of the SAP Cloud SDK is to execute asynchronous HTTP requests.
This can either happen via a generated [OData](./odata/execute-request#setting-middlewares) or [OpenAPI](./openapi/execute-request#setting-middlewares) client or the [http client](./connectivity/http-client#setting-middlewares).
Either way, the final result after fetching destinations and doing various other things is an [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) request.
Sometimes you want to adjust the way the SAP Cloud SDK executes the axios request.

The middleware adds a very flexible way to add custom functionality to the request execution.
You can add multiple middlewares to adjust requests to your needs.

```ts
executeHttpRequest(
  { url: 'http://example.com' },
  {
    middleware: [middlewareA, middlewareB,...],
    method: 'get'
  }
);
```

The API for a middleware is as follows:

```ts
/**
 * Type defining the function passed from one middleware to the next one.
 */
export type MiddlewareFunction = (
  request: HttpRequest
) => Promise<HttpResponse>;

/**
 * The actual middleware type returning a function.
 */
export type Middleware = (options: MiddlewareOptions) => MiddlewareFunction;

/**
 * The input options of the middleware.
 */
export interface MiddlewareOptions {
  fn: MiddlewareFunction;
  context: HttpMiddlewareContext;
  skipNext: () => void;
}
```

Every middleware takes the `MiddlewareOptions` as input and returns a `MiddlewareFunction` instance.
The `MiddlewareOptions` have the following properties:

- The `fn()` function is the returned function from the previous middleware.
  For the last one it is the original HTTP request from the SAP Cloud SDK.
  Note that the type of the input and return function are the same.
- The `context` provides information on the request like URL, headers and HTTP method.
- The `skipNext` will exit all following middlewares

Note that a middleware should **not** execute the function but construct and return a `MiddlewareFunction`.
You can think of middlewares as a composition of functions where each middleware composes a new function.
This makes a chain of middlewares different from a pipeline where the functions are executed one after another.
This may seem abstract now, but the examples in the next sections will bring some concreteness to the topic.

## Implementation of a Middleware

In this section you learn how to implement a middleware based on a didactic example.
The following middleware logs a text and leaves the original function unchanged.

```ts
const doSomethingBeforeMiddleware = options => {
  return request => {
    console.log('Implement something here.');
    options.fn(request);
  };
};
```

In the example the custom code executes before the function `fn()`.
Do this when you want to adjust things before the actual HTTP request is executed.
If you want to process the result of the function your middleware implement it the following way

```ts
const doSomethingAfterMiddleware = options => {
  return request => {
    options.fn(request).then(response => {
      console.log('Do some postprocessing.');
      return response;
    });
  };
};
```

Remember that code you put outside the returned function is executed when the functions are composed.
This is in general not what you want.

```ts
const unintendedMiddleware = options => {
  console.log(
    'Executed when middleware is added - not what you want in general'
  );
  return options.fn;
};
```

The example above is not really useful but also not harmful.
Remember that a middleware must **not** execute the original function.
It adds functionality to the function and creates a new function from it.
If you execute it the whole middleware composition idea is destroyed.

```ts
const wrongMiddleware = options => {
  //This would execute the function while the middlewares are added - Do NOT do this.
  const responseRunning = options.fn(someArgs);
  return request => responseRunning;
};
```

## Execution Order of Multiple Middlewares

A good practice is to define reusable, single-purpose middlewares.
You can add multiple of those middlewares to combine the effects.
Assume you want to modify your call to have a timeout and use a fallback.
The implementation of these middlewares could look like this:

```ts
const timeoutMiddleware = options => {
  return request => Promise.race([options.fn(request), timeoutPromise]);
};

const fallbackMiddleware = options => {
  return request => {
    try {
      return options.fn(request);
    } catch (e) {
      //implement some fallback logic
    }
  };
};
```

Multiple middlewares are added one-by-one to the request.
The elements are combined as if the composition operator &#8728; for functions is used.

```
[middlewareA,middlewareB,...] -> middlewareA after middlewareB after ...
```

If you include the fallback and timeout middleware to your request in the following way:

```ts
executeHttpRequest(
  { url: 'http://example.com' },
  {
    middleware: [fallbackMiddleware, timeoutMiddleware],
    method: 'get'
  }
);
```

it would mean `fallbackMiddleware` after `timeoutMiddleware` or a bit more detailed:

- The initial function is a `GET` request to `http://example.com` called _f<sub>0</sub>_.
- The timeout is added first to the HTTP request leading _h<sub>1</sub>_ in the picture below.
  Therefore, at execution the timeout only counts the execution time of _f<sub>0</sub>_ and not considering a fallback call.
- After this the fallback is added around _h<sub>1</sub>_ which is the function with timeout.
  So the fallback would also handle failures due to the timeout.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Middleware execution order"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('img/middleware_light.svg'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('img/middleware_dark.svg')
  }}
  className="center"
  width="100%"
/>

If you switched the order of the middlewares:

```ts
executeHttpRequest(
  { url: 'http://example.com' },
  {
    middleware: [timeoutMiddleware, fallbackMiddleware],
    method: 'get'
  }
);
```

the timeout would apply to the original request plus additional time for a potential fallback calls (see _g<sub>1</sub>_ and _g<sub>2</sub>_ in the picture above).
The fallback would not handle a failure due to a timeout.
From this example, you see that the order of middlewares is crucial.

The provided default resilience middlewares should be added in the following order:

1. retry
2. circuit breaker
3. timeout

The SAP Cloud SDK provides default resilience middlewares so that you do not have to worry about the details in most cases.
You can find detailed information on the resilience topic in a [dedicated documentation](../guides/resilience).

## Use the Middleware Context

The previous examples did not use the middleware context.
However, the context provides useful information you can use in your middleware.

```ts
/**
 * Represents the execution context of a middleware.
 */
export interface HttpMiddlewareContext {
  readonly tenantId: string;
  readonly uri: string;
  readonly jwt?: string;
  readonly destinationName?: string;
}
```

The fallback middleware could consider the URI:

```ts
const fallbackMiddleware = options => {
  return (request: HttpRequest) => {
    try {
      return options.fn(request);
    } catch (e) {
      if (options.context.uri === 'http://system-one.com') {
        //do something
      } else {
        //do something else
      }
    }
  };
};
```

If you want to change the request parameters you can modify them as well.
The SAP Cloud SDK uses the axios client which has a `timeout` property.
You could set a timeout on client level like this:

```ts
const clientTimeoutMiddleware = options => {
  return request => {
    return options.fn({ ...request, timeout: 500 });
  };
};
```

## Benefits of Middlewares

You could implement many use cases of middlewares also directly.
You could implement a fallback using a global try/catch.

```ts
try {
  executeHttpRequest(destination, options);
} catch (e) {
  //implement fallback logic
}
```

However, this has two disadvantages:

- The first one is more of cosmetic nature.
  The middlewares encourage you to implement the logic in a separate function which can be reused in different places.
  Your actual business code stays clean.
  This becomes even more obvious for [typed clients](./odata/execute-request) which represent you business requirements more directly.
- The second one is about the position where you can include the code.
  With the middleware you can include logic directly to the HTTP layer.
  This is much more powerful than code on the outer layer.

Assume you want to replace the HTTP client of the SAP Cloud SDK with a different one.
Only with a middleware this is possible.
You have to adjust the request so that it matches your client and the response so that it matches the expected form.

```ts
import httpClient from 'some-client-like-node-fetch';

const replaceHttpClientMiddleware = options => {
  return request => {
    const castedRequest = castRequest(options.context.fnArgument);
    return httpClient(castedRequest).then(response => castResponse(response));
  };
};
```
