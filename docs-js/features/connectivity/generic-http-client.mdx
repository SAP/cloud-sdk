## Intro

The [Executing a request using a generated OData client](../odata/execute-odata-request.mdx) section explains how to make OData requests using the generated OData client.

This page explains how you can perform arbitrary HTTP requests using the SAP Cloud SDK.
The HTTP client provided by the SAP Cloud SDK provides some convinience features which are explained in detail on this page.

## When to use what?

If a OData client can satisfy your requirements, it is always recommended to use that client directly as it provides the best convinience for interacting with OData APIs.

In case the OData client does not satisfy your requirements, the next thing you should look into is the HTTP client which is explained in this page.
It is based on the open-source [axios HTTP client](https://axios-http.com) but provides convinience features which are specific to working on SAP Business Technology Platform.

If the provided HTTP client does also not work for your use-case, we recommend using the [axios client](https://axios-http.com/docs/example) directly.

## `executeHttpRequest`

The most basic way to use the SAP Cloud SDK HTTP client is the function `executeHttpRequest`.

```ts
executeHttpRequest(destination, requestConfig, httpRequestOptions): Promise<HttpResponse>;
```

In the most simple form, this can be invoked like this:

```ts
const response = await executeHttpRequest(
    {
        url: "https://httpbin.org/get"
    },
    {
        method: 'get'
    },
    {
    }
);
```

The `executeHttpRequest` function takes the following parameters:

- `destination` is of type `DestinationOrFetchOptions`
  - This can either be a <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.Destination" name="destination object" /> which was already fetched or an <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.DestinationFetchOptions" name="object containing a destination name and an optional JWT" />
- `requestConfig` is of type <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="types/sap_cloud_sdk_http_client.HttpRequestConfig" name="HttpRequestConfig" /> or <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="types/sap_cloud_sdk_http_client.HttpRequestConfigWithOrigin" name="HttpRequestConfigWithOrigin" />
  - 
- `httpRequestOptions` is of type `HttpRequestOptions`

Note that the `destination` and the `requestConfig` parameter have an overlap in the keys they accept.
For example, both have an `url` property.
For keys that exist for both objects, the `requestConfig` takes precedence.

The `executeHttpRequest` function returns an instance of <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_http_client.HttpResponse" name="HttpResponse" />.
