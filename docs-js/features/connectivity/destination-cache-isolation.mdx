The SAP Cloud SDK provides the option to cache destinations for efficiency reasons.
Cached destination need to be isolated to the correct users.

This guide explains the different options for destination caching with the SAP Cloud SDK.
The general destination lookup is described in [this guide](./destination.mdx).

## Destination Service Cache

To reduce the number of calls to the destination service, you can enable the destination cache.
All the discussed options apply to the `execute()` and `getDestination()` methods of the SAP Cloud SDK.
The destination caching is disabled by default.
Setting the `useCache` flag to `true` enables it:

```ts
.execute({ destinationName: 'myDestination', jwt: 'yourJWT', useCache: true })
```

A cached destination is stored for 5 minutes in the cache.
The SAP Cloud SDK tries to set the proper isolation strategy for the destination automatically.
There are two options:

- `Tenant`: The destination is cached for a tenant and different users will hit the same cache entry.
- `TenantUser`: The destination is cached separately for each user of a tenant.

The SAP Cloud SDK sets the isolation based on the provided JWT:

- No JWT: Isolation is set to `Tenant` and value for the tenant is the provider account.
- JWT without `user_id`: Isolation is set to `Tenant` and the value for the tenant is the `zid` of the JWT.
- JWT with `user_id`: Isolation is set to `TenantUser` and values are taken from `zid` and `user_id`.

This is a safe choice which prevents privilege escalation due to caching.
The first two cases are typical for user-independent authentication flows.
Examples of such a flow are `BasicAuthentication`, `ClientCertificateAuthentication` or `OAuth2ClientCredentials`.

There are cases where the choice made by the SAP Cloud SDK is not optimal.
Assume you have a multi-tenant scenario and you need to pass the JWT to obtain the destination for the right tenant.

The JWT contains a `user_id` but the destination flow is user-independent.
The SAP Cloud SDK would use isolation `TenantUser`, although `Tenant` would be sufficient.

In such a case, you can manually enforce weaker isolation:

```ts
.execute({
  destinationName: 'myDestination',
  jwt: 'yourJWT',
  isolationStrategy: IsolationStrategy.Tenant
})
```

:::caution

Be very careful with this option.
You should know what you're doing when manually downgrading the isolation strategy from `TenantUser` level.
An erroneous configuration can have severe consequences like privilege escalation between users.

### Custom Destination Service Cache

When the cache option is enabled, the SAP Cloud SDK stores the fetched destinations in an in-memory cache.
However, in certain cases, a persistent or distributed cache may be more suitable according to your application architecture.

To create your custom destination cache provider, implement the `DestinationCacheInterface` interface shown below and define the `get`, `set`, and `clear` methods.

```ts
export interface DestinationCacheInterface {
  hasKey(key: string): Promise<boolean>;
  get(key: string | undefined): Promise<Destination | undefined>;
  set(key: string | undefined, item: CacheEntry<Destination>): Promise<void>;
  clear(): Promise<void>;
}
```

Note that each item in the cache is represented using the type `CacheEntry<T>` which defines two properties:

- `entry`, the item you want to store, and
- `expires`, the expiration time for an individual cache item, this is optional.

Once you have implemented your custom cache provider, you can tell the SAP Cloud SDK to use it in place of the default one.
Pass your custom destination cache provider to the `setDestinationCache()` method before the first calls to either the `getDestination()` or the generic client's `executeHttpRequest()` function.

```ts
class CustomCacheProvide implements DestinationCacheInterface {
  // your custom implementation
}

setDestinationCache(new CustomCacheProvider());
```

All subsequent calls to fetch destinations will use the custom cache.

## Register Destination Cache

The `registerDestination()` function is like a manual cache for destinations.
This function behaves similarly to the destination service cache discussed above.
The [destination lookup guide](./destination.mdx) explains the usage of this function in more detail.

```ts
import { registerDestination } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity';

const destination = {
  name: 'FORWARD-DESTINATION',
  url: 'https://mys4hana.com'
};

registerDestination(destination, { jwt: 'yourJWT' });
```

The isolation strategy is automatically detected and applied based on the given JWT:

- No JWT: Isolation is set to `Tenant` and value for the tenant is the provider account.
- JWT without `user_id`: Isolation is set to `Tenant` and the value for the tenant is the `zid` of the JWT.
- JWT with `user_id`: Isolation is set to `TenantUser` and values are taken from `zid` and `user_id`.

You can override the automatically detected isolation strategy.

```ts
registerDestination(destination, {
  jwt: 'yourJWT',
  isolationStrategy: IsolationStrategy.Tenant
});
```
