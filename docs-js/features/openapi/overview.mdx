## OpenAPI & the SAP Cloud SDK

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard is a popular format to define RESTful APIs.
Together with [OData](../odata/overview.mdx) OpenAPI is one of the key API definition formats used at SAP.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient tooling to make the consumption of OpenAPI services easy and convenient on SAP Business Technology Platform.

### OpenAPI Code Generator

We developed an [OpenAPI code generator](generate-openapi-client.mdx) from the ground up.
It's a [command line tool (CLI)](generate-openapi-client.mdx#options-of-the-openapi-cli) capable of converting any OpenAPI specification into a TypeScript or JavaScript type-safe client library that is seamlessly integrated with other SAP Cloud SDK features like:

- [connectivity](../connectivity/destination.mdx)
- multi-tenancy
- authentication
- destinations
- and other abstractions of the SAP Business Technology Platform.

We support both OpenAPI versions **2.0** and **3.0**.
You can use the OpenAPI generator to create a client library for any OpenAPI-based API service available on the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/) or found elsewhere in the Internet.
If you encounter any problems or errors with OpenAPI tooling give us feedback via our [support channels](/docs/overview/get-support).
