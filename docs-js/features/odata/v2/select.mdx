When reading entities, the API offers `select( ... )` on the builders.
Through it, the query parameters `$select` and `$expand` are set.
It restricts the response to the given selection of properties in the request.

The properties that can be selected or expanded are represented via fields on the `schema` property of the entity API class.
There will be a field for each property, e.g. the `businessPartnerApi` has `schema.FIRST_NAME` as a representation of a property and `schema.TO_BUSINESS_PARTNER_ADDRESS` as a representation of a navigation property.

A navigation property means that there is a relation between a business partner and their addresses.
In this case, one business partner can have multiple addresses.
In SAP S/4HANA, navigation properties typically start with `TO_`.

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getAll()
  .select(
    businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME,
    businessPartnerApi.schema.LAST_NAME,
    businessPartnerApi.schema.TO_BUSINESS_PARTNER_ADDRESS
  )
  .execute(destination);
```

The above translates to the following query parameters:

```sql
$select=FirstName,LastName,to_BusinessPartnerAddress/*&$expand=to_BusinessPartnerAddress
```

One can also select properties of the expanded navigation property:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi, businessPartnerAddressApi } =
  businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getAll()
  .select(
    businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME,
    businessPartnerApi.schema.TO_BUSINESS_PARTNER_ADDRESS.select(
      businessPartnerAddressApi.schema.ADDRESS_ID,
      businessPartnerAddressApi.schema.CITY_CODE
    )
  )
  .execute(destination);
```

The above translates to the following query parameters:

```sql
$select=FirstName,to_BusinessPartnerAddress/AddressID,to_BusinessPartnerAddress/CityCode&$expand=to_BusinessPartnerAddress
```
