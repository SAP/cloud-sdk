The function import request builder helps build a request for service operations including their parameters.
Not all services expose function imports.
The example uses the [Warehouse Outbound Delivery Order service](https://api.sap.com/api/API_WHSE_OUTB_DLV_ORDER/resource).
To learn how to generate an API client from the service definition, look at [this article](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx).

The example below creates a function import request builder for the service operation `PostGoodsIssue` and then executes it against your destination.

```ts
const {
  functionImports: { postGoodsIssue }
} = warehouseOutboundDeliveryOrderService();

postGoodsIssue({ outboundDeliveryOrder: 'order' }).execute(destination);
```

The service operation is defined in the service metadata.

If the response structure does not match the transformation type, the promise from `execute(destination)` will be resolved into `undefined`.

The default transformer expects the following response format:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Count": 0
  }
}
```

Assume the actual response has an additional layer `Foo`:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Foo": {
      "Count": 0
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, `dataAccessor` can be used in the following way to modify the response into the desired form for further deserialization.

```ts
functionImportRequestBuilder.execute(destination, data => data.d.Foo);
```
