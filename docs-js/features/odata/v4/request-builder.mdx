OData supports operations, called actions and functions.

Actions may have side-effects, functions may not have side-effects.

Actions and functions work quite similar but have differences in some details.
In the following, we'll refer to _operations_ when something applies both to _functions_ and _actions_.

Operations can be _bound_ or _unbound_.
Bound means that the operation is tied to an entity.
This is similar to how a method is tied to a class instance in object oriented languages, while functions or "static" methods are not tied to an instance.

To learn how to generate an API client from the service definition, look at [this article](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx).

### Using Operations

Bound operations are generated into their respective entity class.

They can be called on the entity class like in the following example:

```ts
const { catalogApi } = catalogService();

const entity = catalogApi.requestBuilder().getByKey(42).execute(destination);

entity.boundActionWithoutArguments({}).execute(destination);
entity
  .boundActionWithArguments({ argument1: 'foo', argument2: 'bar' })
  .execute(destination);

entity.boundFunctionWithoutArguments({}).execute(destination);
entity
  .boundFunctionWithArguments({ argument1: 'foo', argument2: 'bar' })
  .execute(destination);
```

Unbound operations are generated into `actionImports` and `functionImports` respectively.

The following code snippet shows the syntax for using them:

```ts
const {
  actionImports: { unboundActionWithArguments, unboundActionWithoutArguments },
  functionImports: {
    unboundFunctionWithArguments,
    unboundFunctionWithoutArguments
  }
} = catalogService();

unboundActionWithoutArguments({}).execute(destination);
unboundActionWithArguments({ argument1: 'foo', argument2: 'bar' }).execute(
  destination
);

unboundFunctionWithoutArguments({}).execute(destination);
unboundFunctionWithArguments({ argument1: 'foo', argument2: 'bar' }).execute(
  destination
);
```

### Response Transformation

If the response structure does not match the transformation type, the promise from `execute(destination)` will be resolved into `undefined`.

The default transformer expects the following response format:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Count": 0
  }
}
```

Assume the actual response has an additional layer `Foo`:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Foo": {
      "Count": 0
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, `dataAccessor` can be used in the following way to modify the response into the desired form for further deserialization.

```ts
functionImportRequestBuilder.execute(destination, data => data.d.Foo);
```
