When reading entities, the API offers `select( ... )` on the builders.
Note that for OData v4 a `select` does not automatically expand navigation properties.
See [here](#expand-and-select) for details on select and expand.
For non-navigational property the `select` behaves as follows:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getAll()
  .select(
    businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME,
    businessPartnerApi.schema.LAST_NAME
  )
  .execute(destination);
```

The above translates to the following query parameters:

```sql
$select=FirstName,LastName
```
