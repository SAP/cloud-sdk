You can pass retrieve requests directly to the `batch()` function.
Once you execute a batch request you get a list of [`BatchResponse`](#responses).
A `BatchResponse` that corresponds with a retrieve request can either be a `ReadResponse` or an `ErrorResponse`.

In the example below, you map each given address ID to a [`GetByKeyRequestBuilder`](#getbykey-request-builder).
These retrieve requests are combined into one batch request and executed against a destination.

The example below is based on the [Bills of Material service](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_BILLING_DOCUMENT_SRV_0001/overview), which contains a function import called `getPdf()`.
This service is an OData v2 service, but the syntax is the same for OData v2 and v4.

```ts
const {
  billingDocumentApi,
  functionImports: { getPdf }
} = billingDocumentService();

async function batchExample(documentIds: string[]) {
  const getByKeyRequests = documentIds.map(billingDocument =>
    billingDocumentApi.requestBuilder().getByKey(billingDocument)
  );
  const functionImportRequests = documentIds.map(billingDocument =>
    getPdf({ billingDocument })
  );

  // Execute batch request combining multiple retrieve requests
  const batchResponses = await batch(
    ...getByKeyRequests,
    ...functionImportRequests
  );
}
```
