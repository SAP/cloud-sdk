OData batch requests combine multiple operations into one POST operation, allowing you to execute multiple requests with just one network call.
This can significantly reduce the network overhead you have to deal with when you want to execute many requests.

Every SAP Cloud SDK client provides a `batch` function that takes [retrieve requests](#retrieve-request) and [changesets](#changeset).
You can combine those arbitrarily.
To execute batch requests, use the `execute` method - it works the same way as for single requests.

The response of a `batch` request is a list of `BatchResponse`s.
Each of the items in the response is either a `ReadResponse`, `WriteResponses` or an `ErrorResponse`, see [Responses](#responses).
