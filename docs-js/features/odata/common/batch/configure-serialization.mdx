By default, URLs in the multipart representation of a request are serialized to a path relative to the service, e.g.:

```
GET /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
```

However, some services might only understand URLs relative to the entity or even absolute URLs.

To configure the serialization of the URLs within a batch request, you can set the subrequest path type using the `withSubRequestPathType()` method.
You can choose from the following options:

- `relativeToService` (default), which yields URLs relative to the service
- `relativeToEntity`, which yields URLs relative to the entity
- `absolute`, which produces absolute URLs
- `noPath`, which only returns the entity with no preceding path

See below for examples:

Serialize subrequest path relative to entity:

```ts
// GET /A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
batch(...requests).withSubRequestPathType('relativeToEntity');
```

Serialize subrequest without a preceding path (like `relativetoEntity` without a leading slash):

```ts
// GET A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
batch(...requests).withSubRequestPathType('noPath');
```

Serialize subrequest path as absolute URL:

```ts
// GET https://my-s4.system.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
batch(...requests).withSubRequestPathType('absolute');
```
