In addition to basic properties, filters can also be applied to one-to-one navigation properties.
The example below shows how to filter on the `TO_CUSTOMER`, which is a one-to-one navigation property of the BusinessPartner entity.
Please note, that the `CUSTOMER_NAME` and `CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_GROUP` are properties of the entity `Customer`, which is the type of the one-to-one navigation property `TO_CUSTOMER`.

<Tabs groupId="version" defaultValue="major" values={[ { label: 'SDK 2.x', value: 'major' }, { label: 'SDK 1.x', value: 'deprecated' } ]}>
<TabItem value="major">

```ts
/*
  Get all business partners that match all the following conditions:
    - Have customer with the customer name 'John'
    - Have customer with the customer account group '0001'
*/
.filter(
  businessPartnerApi.schema.TO_CUSTOMER.filter(
    customerApi.schema.CUSTOMER_NAME.equals('John'),
    customerApi.schema.CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_GROUP.equals('0001')
  )
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="deprecated">

```ts
/*
  Get all business partners that match all the following conditions:
    - Have customer with the customer name 'John'
    - Have customer with the customer account group '0001'
*/
.filter(
  BusinessPartner.TO_CUSTOMER.filter(
    Customer.CUSTOMER_NAME.equals('John'),
    Customer.CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_GROUP.equals('0001')
  )
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The generated `$filter` will be:

```sql
$filter=((to_Customer/CustomerName eq 'John' and to_Customer/CustomerAccountGroup  eq '0001'))
```
