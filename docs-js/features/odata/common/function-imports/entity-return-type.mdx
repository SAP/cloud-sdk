:::note Troubleshooting

For some OData functions or action imports, the `execute()` method might be missing as intended.
Typically, this might happen when an entity type is shared by multiple entity sets and is used as the return type of OData function or action imports.
In such a case you can use `executeRaw` method for getting the raw response returned after invoking the OData function or action via type-safe API and deserialize it on your own.
