Function or action imports do not support ETag handling automatically.
If your service requires the version identifier of an entity to be present, you can pass it to the request on your own using the `addCustomHeaders()` method (see example below).
With this approach, you have to retrieve the required entity with a `GET` request, before executing the operation.
Note, that if the operation execution succeeds, the version identifier of your entity will be outdated.

```ts
operationRequestBuilder()
  .addCustomHeaders({ 'if-match': entity.versionIdentifier })
  .execute(destination);
```
