The operation request builder helps build a request for service operations such as function and action imports if they are exposed.

:::note
Please notice that action imports are only supported in OData v4.
But the usage of function and action imports are similar.
:::

The example below execute an action import from the [Inbound Delivery (A2X)](https://api.sap.com/api/API_INBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002/overview) service against a destination.
To learn how to generate an API client from the service definition, look at [this article](../../generate-odata-client.mdx).

```ts
import { postGoodsReceipt } from './inbound/API_INBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002';
postGoodsReceipt({ deliveryDocument: '123456' }).execute(destination);
```
