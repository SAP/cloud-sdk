If the response structure does not match the transformation type, the promise from `execute(destination)` will be resolved into `undefined`.

The default transformer expects the following response format:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Count": 0
  }
}
```

Assume the actual response has an additional layer `Foo`:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Foo": {
      "Count": 0
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, `dataAccessor` can be used in the following way to modify the response into the desired form for further deserialization.

```ts
operationRequestBuilder.execute(destination, data => data.d.Foo);
```
