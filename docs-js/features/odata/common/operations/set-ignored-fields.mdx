If you changed properties on an entity, that you do not want to send in the payload of the update request, use the `setIgnoredFields()` method to ignore them.

In the following example, the `PATCH` request won't contain changes that were made to the `FIRST_NAME` property of the business partner.

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
// Get a business partner
const businessPartner = await businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getByKey('1')
  .execute({ destinationName: 'myDestination' });

// Change first name and last name
businessPartner.firstName = 'Steve';
businessPartner.lastName = 'Smith';

// Send a PATCH request with `{ "LastName" : "Smith" }`  and do not include the changed first name
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .update(businessPartner)
  .setIgnoredFields(businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME);
```
