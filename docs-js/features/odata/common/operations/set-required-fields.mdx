If you want to send properties in the payload of the update request, that you did not change, use the `setRequiredFields()` method to add them.

In the following example, the `PATCH` request will contain the `FIRST_NAME` property of the business partner, even if it didn't change.

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
// Get a business partner
const businessPartner = await businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getByKey('1')
  .execute({ destinationName: 'myDestination' });

// Change last name
businessPartnerResponse.lastName = 'Smith';

// Send a PATCH request with `{ "LastName" : "Smith", "FirstName": "Steve" }`  and include the first name although it was not changed
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .update(businessPartner)
  .setRequiredFields(businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME);
```
