If you want to send properties in the payload of the update request, that you did not change, use the `setRequiredFields` method to add them.

In the following example, the `PATCH` request will contain the `FIRST_NAME` property of the business partner, even if it didn't change.

<Tabs groupId="version" defaultValue="major" values={[ { label: 'SDK 2.x', value: 'major' }, { label: 'SDK 1.x', value: 'deprecated' } ]}>
<TabItem value="major">

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
// First we get a businesspartner with the id of "1".
const businessPartner = businessPartnerApi
    .requestBuilder()
    .getByKey('1')
    .execute({destinationName: 'myDestination'});

// Then we change the business partner's last name to "Smith".
businessPartner.then((businessPartnerResponse) => (businessPartnerResponse.lastName = 'Smith'));

// Finally we update the business partner with the updated last name, but still include their first name in the "PATCH" request.
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .update(businessPartner)
  .setRequiredFields(businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="deprecated">

```ts
// First we get a businesspartner with the id of "1".
const businessPartner = BusinessPartner
    .requestBuilder()
    .getByKey('1')
    .execute({destinationName: 'myDestination'});

// Then we change the business partner's last name to "Smith".
businessPartner.then((businessPartnerResponse) => (businessPartnerResponse.lastName = 'Smith'));

// Finally we update the business partner with the updated last name, but still include their first name in the "PATCH" request.
BusinessPartner
  .requestBuilder()
  .update(businessPartner)
  .setRequiredFields(BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
