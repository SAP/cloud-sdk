The `GetByKeyRequestBuilder` class allows you to create a request to retrieve one entity based on its key:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getByKey('id');
```

The example above retrieves the `BusinessPartner` with the ID `'id'`.

The result can be restricted by applying the [select](#select) function, same as in the [GetAll](#getall-request-builder) request.
