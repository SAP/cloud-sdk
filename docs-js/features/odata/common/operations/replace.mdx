To replace an entity instead of just updating specific fields, use the`replaceWholeEntityWithPut()` method:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();

businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .update(businessPartner)
  .replaceWholeEntityWithPut();
```

This will send a PUT request and include all existing properties on your entity, whether they were changed or not.
