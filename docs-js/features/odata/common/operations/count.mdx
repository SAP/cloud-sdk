The method `count()` allows you to get the number of elements in a collection.
It is only available for `getAll()` requests and is added before the request execution:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().count();
```

The return type of count requests is a `Promise<number>`.
You can combine the `count()` with filter conditions.
To get the number of business partners with first name `John` execute the following request:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .filter(businessPartnerApi.schema.FIRST_NAME.equals('John'))
  .count()
  .getAll();
```

As defined in the OData spec `count` is not affected by `top`, `skip`, and `orderBy`.
:::note `top()` and `skip()` are ignored for count
If you include these methods in a count request they will be ignored by the SAP Cloud SDK.
These three requests will all return the same value.

```ts
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().top(5).count();
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().skip(5).count();
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().count();
```
