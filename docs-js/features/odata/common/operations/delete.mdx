The Delete request builder allows you to create `DELETE` requests, that delete an entity.

<Tabs groupId="version" defaultValue="major" values={[ { label: 'SDK 2.x', value: 'major' }, { label: 'SDK 1.x', value: 'deprecated' } ]}>
<TabItem value="major">

```ts
/*
  The following won't work on the real SAP S/4HANA BusinessPartner service because BusinessPartners cannot be deleted.
  We added this only for the sake of the example.
*/
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().delete(businessPartner);
```

 </TabItem>
<TabItem value="deprecated">

```ts
/*
  The following won't work on the real SAP S/4HANA BusinessPartner service because BusinessPartners cannot be deleted.
  We added this only for the sake of the example.
*/
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().delete(businessPartner);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Be aware that delete requests will fail if their ETag doesn't match.
