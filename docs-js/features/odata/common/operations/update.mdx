The update request builder allows you to change existing entities.
By default, `PATCH` is used to only update changed fields.

The following example first gets a business partner, changes one of its values, and then sends an update request.

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();

// Get a business partner
const businessPartner = await businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getByKey('1')
  .execute({ destinationName: 'myDestination' });

// Change first name
businessPartner.firstName = 'Steve';

// Send a PATCH request with `{ "FirstName" : "Steve" }`
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().update(businessPartner);
```

The code above changed the first name of the given business partner.
The payload sent to the service with `PATCH` includes only the first name.

Be aware that update requests will fail if their ETags don't match.
Check out the [ETag](#handling-of-etags) section for more information.
