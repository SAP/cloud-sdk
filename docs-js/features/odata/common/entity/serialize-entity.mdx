Other rare cases will bring you to the situation where you want to serialize your Entity back to the oData structure you did receive before.
If you need to transform it from your SAP Cloud SDK representation of an entity back to a oData representation,
you can use the `executeRaw()` functionality directly within your original request or
you can serialize the SDK representation / entity by using the `serializeEntity` function.
This function is part of the common oData service and has to be imported from the SAP Cloud SDK `odata-common` package.

```ts
import {
  entitySerializer
} from '@sap-cloud-sdk/odata-common';
import { businessPartnerService } from './generated/business-partner-service';

const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();

const deserializedEntity = businessPartnerApi
  .entityBuilder()
  .firstName('Peter')
  .lastName('Pan')
  .toBusinessPartnerAddress([
    businessPartnerAddressApi.entityBuilder().country('Neverland').build()
  ])
  .build();

const serializedEntity = entitySerializer(
  businessPartnerApi.deSerializers
).serializeEntity(deserializedEntity, businessPartnerApi);

console.log(serializedEntity); 
=> {
  FirstName: 'Peter',
  LastName: 'Pan',
  to_BusinessPartnerAddress: [
    {
      Country: 'Neverland'
    }
  ]
}
```
