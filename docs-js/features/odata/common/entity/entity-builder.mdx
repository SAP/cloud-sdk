The API class provides an entity builder with the `entityBuilder()` method.
You can set the properties using a fluent API.
The `build()` method will return the new entity.

```ts
import { businessPartnerService } from './generated/business-partner-service';

const { businessPartnerApi, businessPartnerAddressApi } =
  businessPartnerService();

businessPartnerApi.entityBuilder().firstName('Peter').lastName('Pan').build();
```

You can create navigation properties that link to other entities using their respective builders.
Navigation properties with a one-to-many relation require an array of entities as a parameter.
This also applies if the array only contains one entity.

The relation to the business partner address is a one-to-many relation here.

```ts
import { businessPartnerService } from './generated/business-partner-service';

const { businessPartnerApi, businessPartnerAddressApi } =
  businessPartnerService();

businessPartnerApi
  .entityBuilder()
  .firstName('Peter')
  .lastName('Pan')
  .toBusinessPartnerAddress([
    businessPartnerAddressApi.entityBuilder().country('Neverland').build()
  ])
  .build();
```

You can also add fields that are unknown according to the specification, if you add them as custom fields.
To achieve this, pass an object to the `withCustomFields()` method.
The keys of the object represent the names of the custom fields and the values their respective values.

```ts
import { businessPartnerService } from './generated/business-partner-service';

const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();

businessPartnerApi
  .entityBuilder()
  .firstName('Peter')
  .withCustomFields({
    myCustomField: 'this is custom'
  })
  .build();
```
