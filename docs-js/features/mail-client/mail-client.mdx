This documentation describes how you can send e-mails from application deployed on the BTP to your e-mail servers.
When defining e-mail servers by using the `destination` service on the BTP, both `Internet` and `On-Prem` destinations are supported.

## Installation
Run this command in your root directory of your project to install the `mail-client` dependency and add it to your `dependency` list:

```
npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/mail-client
```

## Examples
Let's get started by writing a minimal example.

### Send an e-mail
First, create a `mailConfig` that contains all the essential information of an e-mail, including the following below, just like how you send e-mails manually by using e.g., Outlook or Gmail:
- the e-mail address of the sender
- the e-mail addresses of the recipients
- the subject
- the e-mail body

``` ts
import {
  sendMail,
  MailConfig,
  MailClientOptions
} from '@sap-cloud-sdk/mail-client';

const mailConfig: MailConfig = {
  from: 'from@example.com',
  to: 'to@example.com',
  subject: 'e-mail subject',
  text: 'e-mail text'
}
```

Second, we send the e-mail by calling the function `sendMail` with the `mailConfig` created:
``` ts
sendMail(
  { destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' },
  [ mailConfig ]
);
```

The first parameter is either a [destination](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/2.9.0/interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.Destination) object or [DestinationFetchOptions](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/2.9.0/interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.DestinationFetchOptions).
For productive environment, you should use the `destination service` on BTP and reference the destination by name just like the example above.
`{ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }` is the minimal object that is typed as `DestinationFetchOptions`.
For test environment, in addition to using the `DestinationFetchOptions`, you can also pass a complete `destination` object.

:::caution Caution

As the destination object might contain credentials, using it in production should be prohibited.

:::

You can read more about the abstraction of the `destination` in the documentation [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/connectivity/destination).

### Send multiple e-mails
The code snippets below shows how to send 2 e-mails with the `mailConfig` that we created in the previous example.
The e-mails are sent in parallel by default.

``` ts
sendMail(
  { destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' },
  [ mailConfig, mailConfig ]
);
```

#### Send e-mails in sequential
Sometimes you prefer sending e-mail in sequential instead of in parallel due to e.g., the limit of your e-mail server.
You can also provide an optional parameter like the example below:
``` ts
sendMail(
  { destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' },
  [ mailConfig, mailConfig ], {
    sdkOptions: {
      parallel: false
    }
  });
```

:::tip

As the parallelization is the default behaviour, you don't have to set `parallel: true` explicitly.

### Configure `nodemailer`

The SAP Cloud SDK uses a node package `nodemailer` under the wood.
The `nodemailer` supports creating a `transport` based on options listed in their [documentation](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/).
The SDK exposes these options (as `SmtpTransportOptions`) and will transfer them based on user input.
For example, you can provide the `tls` option like below to solve the self signed certificate issue.

``` ts
sendMail(
  { destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' },
  [ mailConfig ], {
    tls: {
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
  });
```

The SDK API documentation of the complete `SmtpTransportOptions` can be found in the api doc [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/2.9.0/interfaces/mailclient_src.SmtpTransportOptions).

#### Proxy
The `nodemailer` also supports defining proxy option as mentioned [here](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/proxies/).
Similar to other `nodemailer` options, the `proxy` key is also part of the `SmtpTransportOptions`.
You can find a minimal example below for defining an HTTP proxy.
``` ts
sendMail(
  { destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' },
  [ mailConfig ], {
    proxy: 'http://my-proxy-host:1234'
  });
```
Using socks proxy is not supported for the time being.

:::caution

The SAP Cloud SDK will pass the proxy option directly to the `nodemailer`, but the proxy feature is not end-to-end tested.
We assume the `nodemailer` lib handles it properly.

:::

## `On-Prem` destination
The SAP Cloud SDK supports using `On-Prem` destination as well.
From the SDK API perspective, the code looks similar, no matter you use `On-Prem` destinations or `Internet` destinations.
The only difference is that you have to reference the name of the On-Prem destination, which is obvious.

### What's the difference
First, for applications deployed on the BTP, you need a `connectivity` service for connecting to an `On-Prem` destination.
Second, a `Cloud Connector` is used as a proxy for accessing the `On-Prem` system.
Therefore, you have to make sure the configuration set up is working.
Here you can find some [documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/8d1f989deca1455dabc3d81b433fbdaf.html) from the BTP.

### SDK scope
As mentioned in this [documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/cd1583775afa43f0bb9ec69d9dbcc880.html?locale=en-US) of the BTP, using `SOCKS5` proxy for accessing `On-Prem` systems from applications on BTP needs `SOCKS5` authentication flow.
The SDK handles the `SOCKS5` implementation for the user when detecting an `On-Prem` mail destination.
The `On-Prem` connectivity is end-to-end tested, but is sometimes flaky due to most likely the target `On-Prem` system.

:::tip

For some `On-Prem` e-mail server, including our test server, the parallelization of sending email might be a challenge.
You can disable the parallelization by passing `parallel: false` as mentioned before.
