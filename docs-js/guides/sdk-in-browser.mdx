The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript can be used both as a backend and frontend library when used in a browser.
Because of the specifics of a browser environment, some features might be unavailable.
To help you get up and running faster in a browser, this document outlines the main steps and caveats of using SAP Cloud SDK on the frontend.
Both Angular and React applications are used to illustrate the usage.

## Prerequisite

A frontend application set up using either of the following:

- [Angular application](https://angular.io/cli/new) via `ng new my-app`
- [React application](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) via `npx create-react-app my-app`.
  Rewire the create-react-app project using [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired#how-to-rewire-your-create-react-app-project) or other alternatives.
  This creates a `config-overrides.js` file in the root directory which can be used to override the settings for various webpack modules.

## Include the SAP Cloud SDK

The example below uses the business partner API.
To learn how to generate an API client from a service definition, refer to [this article](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx).

```ts
//In the .html part of the component
<button (click)="callApi()">Click me!</button>

//In the .ts part of the component
import { businessPartnerService } from './generated/business-partner-service';

const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();

async function callApi(){
  const result = await businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute(myDest)
  console.log(result)
}
```

:::note
For the destination lookup, the SAP Cloud SDK relies on Node.js functionality, e.g., `process.env`.
However, the request building, execution, and result parsing do not require any Node.js modules and can be used on the frontend.
Hence, create the destination variable `myDest` manually.
:::

Executing `npm run build` will result in compilation errors of the kind shown below:

> Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'https' in

Check out the [workaround](#workaround) for resolving such errors.

## Run Locally

As discussed above, the `myDest` can not be fetched via the destination service.
Create and pass the variable when running locally.

```ts
import { Destination } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity';

const myDest: Destination = {
  url: 'https://my123456.s4hana.ondemand.com',
  username: 'myUser',
  password: 'myPassowrd'
};
```

Executing `npm run serve` compiles the project and hosts the application on a local server.

:::info
All modern browsers block requests triggered from a browser to a remote system to ensure [same origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).
One simple way to overcome this issue locally is to disable the web security of the browser temporarily (e.g. `--disable-web-security` for Chrome).
Alternatively, create a second localhost proxy server that adds the `access-allow-origin-header` to the request.
:::

## Run on SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Environment

For productive usage, the methods mentioned above for running locally are not needed.
Configure the `xs-app.json` file of the approuter with an entry as shown below:

```json
{
  "source": "/REMOTE_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER/(.*)",
  "target": "/$1",
  "destination": "DESTINATION_NAME_ON_CF"
}
```

and then, in the application, define the destination as follows:

```ts
import { Destination } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity';

const myDest: Destination = {
  url: '/REMOTE_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER'
};
```

The created request to `/REMOTE_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner` will be matched by the approuter and the destination with the given URL and credentials is used.

The approuter establishes a session with the client (browser) using a session cookie.
This session contains elements like the redirect URL, OAuth token, OAuth scopes, etc.
OAuth token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is fetched from the UAA and forwarded to backend services in the Authorization header.
**The client never gets this token.**

For a detailed understanding of session handling in the application router, refer to the documentation [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/96c7545f62504d55b669010d8fb9c41e.html?version=2.0.00).

:::note
This approach does not support principal propagation to on-premise systems.
For this, you need a JWT and need to include the proper header fields defining the user.
See the documentation on [on-premise systems](../features/connectivity/on-premise) for details.
:::

:::info
With webpack, it is possible to [load resources](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/normal-module-replacement-plugin/) for local or productive usage.
Using such a switch, you can adjust the value of the destination for the two cases.

## Workaround

Webpack version 5 removed the automatic node.js polyfills and they need to be added manually.
An error message during the compilation from TS to JS provides a hint on how to achieve that.

### Angular

- Add the corresponding library of the node.js core modules or the browserified version in `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file
- Include `@angular-builders/custom-webpack` in `devDependencies`
- Create a custom webpack configuration named `node-webpack.config.js` and list the node modules

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        process: 'process/browser',
        https: 'agent-base',
        http: 'agent-base'
      },
      fallback: {
        url: false,
        os: false,
        assert: false,
        constants: false,
        zlib: false,
        path: false,
        http: false,
        util: require.resolve('util/'),
        process: require.resolve('process/browser'),
        stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
        buffer: require.resolve('buffer'),
        crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
        https: require.resolve('https-browserify')
      }
    },
    plugins: [new ProvidePlugin({ process: 'process/browser' })]
  };
  ```

- In the `angular.json` file, adjust the `build` target to use the custom builder and set `path` to the custom config `node-webpack.config.js` defined above

  ```json
  "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser",
    "options": {
      "customWebpackConfig": {
        "path": "./node-webpack.config.js"
      }
    }
  ```

- In the `angular.json` file, adjust the `serve` target to use the custom builder as well

  ```json
  "serve": {
    "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server",
  ```

- In the `package.json` file, exclude the node modules that do not exist in the browser

  ```json
  "browser": {
    "fs": false,
    "net": false,
    "tls": false
  }
  ```

- Proxy any requests to your API server in development by adding a `proxy.config.json` file in `/src` folder
  This avoids the CORS issues.

  ```json
  {
    "/api/*": {
      "target": "REMOTE_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER",
      "secure": true,
      "logLevel": "debug",
      "changeOrigin": true
    }
  }
  ```

  Since the base path has been set in the proxy config, change the value of the `url` property in `myDest` to `/`.
  In the `angular.json` file, adjust the `serve` options to include `proxyConfig`.

  ```json
  "proxyConfig": "src/proxy.conf.json"
  ```

### React

- Add the corresponding library of the core node.js modules in `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file.
  Add the `react-app-rewired` dependency and adjust the existing calls to `react-scripts` in npm scripts for `start`, `build` and `test`

  ```json
  "start": "react-app-rewired start"
  ```

- In the `config-overrides.js` file, list the core node modules

  ```js
  module.exports = function override(config, env) {
    config.ignoreWarnings = [/Failed to parse source map/];
    config.resolve.alias = {
      https: 'agent-base',
      http: 'agent-base'
    };
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      os: false,
      url: false,
      https: false,
      http: false,
      fs: false,
      path: false,
      assert: false,
      zlib: false,
      tls: false,
      net: false,
      constants: false,
      util: require.resolve('util'),
      process: require.resolve('process/browser'),
      stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
      buffer: require.resolve('buffer'),
      console: require.resolve('console-browserify'),
      crypto: require.resolve('crypto-browserify'),
      https: require.resolve('https-browserify')
    };
    config.plugins = [
      ...config.plugins,
      new ProvidePlugin({
        Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']
      }),
      new ProvidePlugin({
        process: 'process/browser'
      })
    ];

    return config;
  };
  ```

- Proxy any requests to your API server in development by adding a proxy field to the `package.json` file.
  This avoids the CORS issues.

  ```json
  "proxy": "REMOTE_SYSTEM_IDENTIFIER",
  ```

  Since the base path has been set in the proxy, change the value of the `url` property in `myDest` to `/`

  :::caution
  This proxy is only for development.
  You need to ensure that API URLs point to the right target in production.
  :::

Now, the project should build and run locally.
