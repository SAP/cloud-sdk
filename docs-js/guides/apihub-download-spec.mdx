This guide demonstrates the steps to download OData and OpenAPI specification files (specs) from SAP API Business Hub.

## When Do I Need A Specification File?

To consume an OData or OpenAPI service, you need to generate a corresponding client.
The documentation of the generator packages can be found below:

- `@sap-cloud-sdk/generator` for generating an OData client (see [doc](../features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx))
- `@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator` for generating an OpenAPI client (see [doc](../features/openapi/generate-openapi-client.mdx))

## Steps To Download A Specification File

1. Go to [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com).
2. Click **login**, as this is necessary for downloading the specs.
3. Search for the service you want to consume like "business partner". The search results should look like the screenshot below.
4. Apply filters for targeting a specific service by clicking the **Show Filters** button. For example, to filter only S/4HANA Cloud services, in the `Product` list, select `SAP S/4HANA Cloud`.

5. Click the service name, when you find your service, so you can see a similar page like the screenshot below.
6. Click **API Specification**

7. Scroll down and download the EDMX file for an OData service. (For OpenAPI, choose YAML or JSON)

:::tip Try out sandbox systems
If you're unsure whether the chosen service is correct, click **Try Out** to test the sandbox system, which exposes a few endpoints.
