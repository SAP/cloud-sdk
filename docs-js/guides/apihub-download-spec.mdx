This guide demonstrates the steps to download OData and OpenAPI specification files (specs) from SAP API Business Hub.

## When Do I Need A Specification File?

When you consume an OData or OpenAPI service and use the following packages, the specs are needed:

- `@sap-cloud-sdk/generator` for generating an OData client (see [doc](../features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx))
- `@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator` for generating an OpenAPI client (see [doc](../features/openapi/generate-openapi-client.mdx))

## Steps To Download A Specification File

1. Go to [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com).
2. Search for the service you want to consume, and you should see the search result like the screenshot below.
3. Click login, as this is necessary for downloading the specs.
4. You can use filters like "SAP S/4HANA Cloud" for targeting your service.

5. Click the service name, when you find your service, so you can see a similar page like the screenshot below.
6. Click the "API Specification"

7. Scroll down and download the "EDMX" file for an OData service. (For OpenAPI, choose YAML or JSON)

:::tip Try out sandbox systems
Sometimes, you are not 100% sure whether you choose the right service.
You can also click "Try Out" for testing the sandbox system, where some endpoints are exposed.
