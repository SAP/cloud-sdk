## 4.1.2 [Core Modules] - September 18, 2025

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity, http-client, openapi, resilience, util] Update `axios` to `1.12.2` to fix vulnerability to DoS attack. Refer [here](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj) for more details. (011b841)

## 4.1.1 [Core Modules] - July 31, 2025

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity, http-client, openapi, resilience, util] Update `axios` to `1.11.0` to use non-vulnerable version of `form-data`. (b502b40)

## 4.1.0 [Core Modules] - July 21, 2025

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] The `getDestinationFromDestinationService()` function no longer verifies the incoming XSUAA JWT against the application's bound XSUAA instance. Consequently, the `cacheVerificationKeys` option is now deprecated and has no effect. (3c19ffa)

### Improvements

- [connectivity] Remove dependency on XSUAA service binding while retrieving destinations using `getDestinationFromDestinationService()` and `getAllDestinationsFromDestinationService()` functions. (3c19ffa)

## 4.0.2 [Core Modules] - March 18, 2025

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Remove destination cache in `getDestinationFromServiceBinding()` function to let cached destinations retrieved in `getDestinationFromDestinationService()` function be added with the `proxyConfiguration` property.
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/resilience@4.0.2
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/util@4.0.2 (4a187d6)

## 4.0.1 [Core Modules] - March 05, 2025

## Fixed Issues

- [eslint-config] Downgrade `@stylistic/eslint-plugin` to v3 as v4 is EMS-only. (97ad0ad)

## 4.0.0 [Core Modules] - March 04, 2025

### Improvements

- [connectivity] Enable destination caching by default when retrieving destinations via the destination service. Change affects behavior of `getDestination()` method, `getAllDestinationsFromDestinationService()` method, generated client's `execute()` method and generic HTTP requests execution using `executeHttpRequest()`. (d69325a)
- [generator, odata-common, odata-v4] Support precision handling during serialization of `Edm.DateTimeOffset` fields in OData v4. (ab6ca60)

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] Disable `iasToXsuaaTokenExchange` by default if not defined. (25c9dd8)
- [connectivity] The following deprecated content has been removed from the package:
  - The behaviour of `getAgentConfig()` function is changed to be asynchronous. The temporary asynchronous function `getAgentConfigAsync()` has been removed.

  - The `DestinationForServiceBindingOptions` interface has been renamed to `DestinationFromServiceBindingOptions`. (7d92a1b)
