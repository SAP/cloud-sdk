## 3.7.0 [Core Modules] - October 17, 2023

### Fixed Issues

- [odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4, generator, generator-common] Do not send `null` values in the request payload for properties that are not set while creating or updating an entity.
- [odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4, generator, generator-common] Fix `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` error that occurs when updating an entity after calling `getByKey`. (bdcf14f85) Fix `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` error that occurs when updating an entity after calling `getByKey`. (bdcf14f85)

## 3.6.0 [Core Modules] - October 02, 2023

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] Proxy configuration is no longer realized through a proxy agent, but with the native axios proxy setting instead. (025b6aa2c)

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Use axios native proxy, instead of proxy agent, which causes connection issues for write requests on SAP Cloud Connector. (025b6aa2c)
- [http-client] Fix CSRF token fetching against OnPremise systems. (c2a2987c5)

## 3.5.0 [Core Modules] - September 13, 2023

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Compare `selectionStrategy` in `DestinationFetchOptions` based on value instead of reference. (7ed5ceb52)
- [connectivity] Fix destination caching for destinations from service bindings. The destinations are not cached repeatedly. The function `getDestinationFromServiceBinding()` returns `undefined` for destinations which have expired JWTs. (bf54df09b)
- [connectivity] Support destinations of type `ClientCertificateAuthentication` without password.
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/resilience@3.5.0
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/util@3.5.0 (2277f9443)
- [odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4] Fix OData v2 serialization for `Edm.Decimal` to serialize to `string`. (ee7477ce2)

## 3.4.0 [Core Modules] - July 31, 2023

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] Deprecate `destinationForServiceBinding()` and `PartialDestinationFetchOptions`. Use `getDestinationFromServiceBinding()` and `ServiceBindingTransformOptions` instead. (bde64634d)

### New Functionalities

- [connectivity] Always add a name to destinations from service bindings created with `getDestinationFromServiceBinding()`. (db0780f1b)
- [connectivity] Support forwarding of auth tokens for destinations from the destination service, service bindings and environment variables. (bde64634d)

### Fixed Issues

- [odata-common, odata-v4] Serialize properties of type "Edm.Decimal" to numbers when they are within the safe range and strings when they are not. (431d2a542)

## 3.3.0 [Core Modules] - July 21, 2023

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] The `expiresIn` property of `authTokens` on a `Destination` can be undefined. (c09b1d06f)
- [connectivity] Deprecate `getAgentConfig()`:

  - Temporarily use replacement function `getAgentConfigAsync()`.
  - Rename `getAgentConfigAsync()` to `getAgentConfig()` in next major version. (36a01f775)

### New Functionalities

- [connectivity] Add option to cache mTLS certificates. (36a01f775)

### Improvements

- [connectivity] Do not rely on XSUAA service when caching service tokens. Cache keys are now based on service credentials URL. (0583836bc)
- [connectivity] Do not rely on the XSUAA service binding to retrieve tenant information when registering destinations. If tenant is unknown and no binding is found, set it to a default value (`'tenant_id'`). (8f54207b6)
- [connectivity] Read mTLS certificates asynchronously. (36a01f775)

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Remove dependency to XSUAA service binding when checking whether a JWT was issued by XSUAA for destination retrieval. Now, the `ext_attr.ehancer` property is checked. (6b58354e8)
- [http-client] Do not set default tenant ID in the context of middlewares, if the tenant ID is unknown. In those cases it will be `undefined` from now on. (8f54207b6)

## 3.2.0 [Core Modules] - May 30, 2023

### New Functionalities

- [connectivity] Enable the use of mTLS certificates for registered destinations on CloudFoundry. (616d77b85)

### Improvements

- [connectivity] Set the default validity time of the client credentials token cache to 5 minutes instead of never expiring. (782b9e37e)

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity, http-client] Forward the user JWT irrespective of the destination authentication type when `forwardAuthToken` is set to true on a destination (56c3f70f4)
- [http-client] Improve CSRF token fetching for large requests. (73ff0ab03)
- [odata-common] Remove encoding of keys in the `getEntityKeys()` as it should only happen once in `getResourcePathForKeys()`.Fixes the error `value.format is not a function` when executing requests for entities with `Edm.Date` type key property. (aa1a4bdb0)
- [resilience] Fix parsing error when the last response in a chain of retries returned undefined.
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/util@3.2.0 (234675fc3)

## 3.1.1 [Core Modules] - April 14, 2023

### Fixed Issues

- [resilience] Fix transpilation on OData generation, where types for 'opossum' could not be found.
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/util@3.1.1 (166a16d82)

## 3.1.0 [Core Modules] - April 06, 2023

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] The combination of `iss` and `jwt` is now supported when fetching destinations. When both properties are set, the `iss` property is no longer ignored. (28b7af86f)

### New Functionalities

- [connectivity] Add support for authentication type `NoAuthentication` on-premise destinations. (039412e59)
- [connectivity] Allow combination of `iss` an `jwt` when fetching a destination. In this case the `iss` URL will be used to fetch the destination service token and `jwt` will be used for the `x-user-token` header of user based authentication types. (28b7af86f)

### Fixed Issues

- [odata-common] Adjust `FromJsonType` to stricter typings in TypeScript 5. (cc8425abc)

## 3.0.2 [Core Modules] - March 23, 2023

### Compatibility Notes

- [odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4] The `ActionFunctionImportRequestBuilderBase` has an additional mandatory type parameter to pass the according (de-)serializer type. This was missing previously due to a bug. (2fa8c36a6)

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Fix the `The proxy configuration is undefined` error for OnPrem `MAIL` destinations by removing the `isHttpDestination` check when adding proxyConfiguration to the destination object.
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/resilience@3.0.2
  - @sap-cloud-sdk/util@3.0.2 (47fc7278d)
- [mail-client] Fix error `Greeting never received` when sending emails to On-Premise mail servers. The `_readableListening` property of socket is set to `true` to allow nodemailer to receive SMTP greeting messages. (47fc7278d)
- [mail-client] Fix `Invalid greeting` error from nodemailer by removing the `transport.verify` function call. (be04dafc2)
- [odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4] Fix batch requests to accept only functions or actions. (2fa8c36a6)

## 3.0.1 [Core Modules] - March 01, 2023

  - @sap-cloud-sdk/util@3.0.1 (c78c16ddf)

## 3.0.0 [Core Modules] - February 28, 2023

### Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] The generic types of `JwtKeyMapping` is simplified so the second type argument `JwtKeysT` are always strings. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity] The `Protocol` enum was replaced with a string literal union type. Now, instead of passing `Protocol.HTTPS` pass 'https'. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity, http-client, openapi, odata-common, odata-v2, resilience] Remove the options `timeout` and `enableCircuitBreaker` from all BTP service interactions i.e. destination and token fetching. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity, http-client, mail-client, openapi, odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4, eslint-config, generator, test-util, util, openapi-generator, generator-common, temporal-de-serializers, resilience] Switch the compilerOptions.module to `Node16` instead of `CommonJS` for better interoperability with ES modules. See the [TypeScript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html) for technical details if needed. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity] The enum `IsolationStrategy` was replaced with a string literal union type of the same name. Use 'tenant' and 'tenant-user' instead of `IsolationStrategy.Tenant` and `IsolationStrategy.Tenant_User`. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity, http-client, odata-common] The `url` property in `Destination` is now optional as destinations of type `MAIL` do not have a URL. (1b974095f)
- [http-client, openapi, odata-common] Remove `timeout()` method from the request builders and the `timeout` options from the `executeHttpRequest()` function.
  Visit the [documentation portal](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/resilience) to see how to add a timeout using middlewares. (1b974095f)
- [http-client] Removed overload of executeHttpRequest
  The overload, that accepted `HttpRequestConfigWithOrigin` as a parameter, is removed and replaced by the function `executeHttpRequestWithOrigin`. (1b974095f)
- [odata-common, generator, util] By default, generation of OData clients fails if a service path cannot be determined. Either provide `servicePath` value in the `options-per-service.json` or set `skipValidation` to true, in which case, `/` will be used. (1b974095f)
- [odata-common] The constructor of `ODataRequestConfig` was changed so that the third parameter cannot be a `string` anymore.
  Passing in a string which was then interpreted as the value for the `Content-Type` HTTP header was deprecated.
  The type of the parameter is now `Record<string, any>`, and if only want to set the `Content-Type` HTTP header you can do so by passing `{'content-type': 'some-value'}` to the constructor. (1b974095f)
- [odata-common] The constructor of the entity API is private to avoid accidental usage. Use the service object to get a API instance. (1b974095f)
- [odata-common, generator, openapi-generator] The `serviceMapping` option of the OData generator has been renamed to `optionsPerService`. The mapping file, `service-mapping.json` has also been renamed to `options-per-service.json`. By default, an options file will not be generated. (1b974095f)
- [odata-common] Setting custom fields in `fromJson` through the `_customFields` property has been removed.
  Add custom properties to your JSON object instead. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The options per service behavior is now the same as for the OpenApi generator.
  For details on how to migrate and what has change look at the migration guide. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The deprecated `forceOverwrite` option of the generator is removed. Use the `overwrite` option instead.
- [generator] The deprecated `generatePackageJson` option of the generator is removed. Use the `packageJson` option instead.
- [generator] The deprecated `writeReadme` option of the generator is removed. Use the `readme` option instead.
- [generator] The deprecated `processesJsGeneration` option of the generator is removed. Use the `transpilationProcesses` option instead.
- [generator] The internal options `sdkAfterVersionScript`, `s4HanaCloud` and `packageVersion` of the generator are removed.
  These were hidden options never meant for external usage and there is no replacement.
- [generator] The deprecated `generateNpmrc` option of the generator is removed. Use the `include` option to add a `.npmrc` to the generated code if needed. (1b974095f)
- [generator] Add `verbose` generator option. By default, only error and warning logs will be displayed. If `verbose` is set to `true`, all logs will be displayed. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The `generateJs` option has been replaced with the `transpile` option. Transpilation is not enabled by default. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The command line argument `inputDir` of the OData generator is renamed to `input`.
  The new `input` options accepts now also file paths and glob patterns. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The OData generator won't automatically rename identifiers to avoid name conflicts.
  The generation process will fail if identifiers have conflicting names.
  Switch on the `skipValidation` flag if you want to generate despite name conflicts and are okay with changed identifier names to avoid conflicts. (1b974095f)
- [generator, openapi-generator, generator-common] Removed the option `versionInPackageJson` from the OData and OpenAPI generator.
  If the option `packageJson` is enabled now a `package.json` with a default version `1.0.0` is created.
  If necessary use the `include` option to add a `package.json` with a custom value.
- [generator, openapi-generator] Removed the option `licenseInPackageJson` from the OData and OpenAPI generator.
  If the option `packageJson` is enabled now a `package.json` with a default license `UNLICENSED` is created.
  If necessary use the `include` option to add a `package.json` with a custom value. (1b974095f)
- [generator, openapi-generator] Rename servicePath to basePath. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The option `generateCSN` is removed. There is no replacement. (1b974095f)
- [generator] The type for paths in the `GeneratorOptions` is changed from `fs.PathLike` to `string`.
  In case you passed a buffer object please resolve it to a string before passing it to the SAP Cloud SDK. (1b974095f)
- [generator, openapi-generator, generator-common] The two generators use the same CLI parsing code now, aligning the way paths are resolved.
  In case you experience problems with the new logic, enable the `verbose` flag to investigate the new paths. (1b974095f)
- [util] The function `variadicArgumentToArray` is replaced by the function `transformVariadicArgumentToArray`. (1b974095f)
- [util] The field `logger` on the interface `LoggerOptions` was not used and is removed from the interface. (1b974095f)
- [openapi-generator] The internal option `packageVersion` of the OpenAPI generator is removed. (1b974095f)
- [openapi-generator] `tsConfig` option has been renamed to `tsconfig`. (1b974095f)
- [generator-common] The generator does not create `d.ts.map` files per default anymore. If you need them include a custom `tsconfig.json`.
- [connectivity, http-client, mail-client, openapi, odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4, eslint-config, generator, test-util, util, openapi-generator, generator-common, temporal-de-serializers, resilience] All SAP Cloud SDK packages ship without `d.ts.map` files from now on.
  Modern IDEs don't require those files for code navigation, thus they are removed to decrease download size of the SDK. (1b974095f)

### New Functionalities

- [connectivity] Support `OAuth2RefreshToken` authentication type (1b974095f)
- [connectivity] Add a `retry` option in the `DestinationFetchOption`.
  Enable this options if the token exchange done by the destination service is unstable. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity, resilience] Add `ResilienceOptions` and `resilience()` function. The function returns an array of middlewares based on the provided options. (1b974095f)
- [http-client, resilience] The request configuration used in the final request is now part of the middleware context.
  User can implement middlewares to change request properties like `headers` using this reference in the middleware context.
  The request configuration contains the `url`, `headers` and all other properties of the HTTP request. (1b974095f)
- [http-client, openapi, odata-common] Introduce the middleware on the request builders and http-client.
  Visit the [documentation portal](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/resilience) to see how to use middlewares. (1b974095f)
- [generator, generator-common] Introduced options `transpile` and `tsconfig` to configure transpilation for generated OData clients. (1b974095f)

### Improvements

- [connectivity] Replace `Protocol` enum with a string literal union type. (1b974095f)
- [connectivity] Replace `IsolationStrategy` enum with union type. (1b974095f)
- [generator] Align naming rules for operations and properties in OData clients by removing `_` prefix (1b974095f)

### Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Fix the combination of providing the `iss` together with `OnPremise` basic destinations. (1b974095f)
- [odata-v2] Allow to update OData v2 entities to `null`. Fixes [3204](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/3204). (1b974095f)
- [generator] Allow OData service to contain an entity name 'Service'. (1b974095f)
- [generator] Now links to the correct generator binary. (1b974095f)
