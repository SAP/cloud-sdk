Need an example for a [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) service](/docs/common/related-projects/cloud-application-model) consumed by the SAP Cloud SDK?
Our colleagues from the [SAP Cloud Application Lifecycle Management (CALM)](/docs/common/overview/who-uses-sap-cloud-sdk#sap-cloud-application-lifecycle-management) team got you covered!
They put together an amazing demo of creating a locally hosted [CAP service](/docs/common/related-projects/cloud-application-model) and running API calls against it with a type-safe client by SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.
This demo will quickly get you up to speed and help make yourself familiar with the main concepts of developing cloud extensions with SAP Cloud SDK and CAP.
