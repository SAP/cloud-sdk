## Quick Start

For a quick start check out the ["Getting Started"](getting-started.mdx) page.

## What is the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript?

The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript is a set of libraries that reduces the effort of building applications on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
It abstracts common tasks on SAP BTP so that you can concentrate on the business logic instead of writing boiler plate code.
The image below shows the general architecture of an application built with the SAP Cloud SDK.

### The Core Libraries

The core libraries are the heart of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.
They contain the request execution and connectivity logic as well as command line interfaces (CLIs) to generate OData and OpenAPI clients.
The image below shows the relationship between the individual core libraries.

#### `@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity`

The connectivity library provides functionality to read and exchange with services like the destination, XSUAA, and connectivity service.
It provides the basic types needed to reflect the concept of a [destination](features/connectivity/destination.mdx) throughout the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.

#### `@sap-cloud-sdk/http-client`

The HTTP client library is a thin HTTP client, that allows you to execute requests by leveraging the concept of destinations.
You can flexibly configure a request to your needs and send arbitrary HTTP requests to the given destination.

#### `@sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v2`, `@sap-cloud-sdk/odata-v4`, and `@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi`

The OData v2, v4, and OpenAPI libraries build the foundation for API clients.
They contain OData and OpenAPI-specific abstractions, that the client libraries use to expose their APIs.

#### `@sap-cloud-sdk/generator` and `@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator`

The OData and OpenAPI generators are CLIs that generate client libraries based on the services' specifications (either EDMX format or OpenAPI/Swagger).
You can use them to generate typed API clients.

### Supported Node Versions

The SAP Cloud SDK always supports the [latest _Active LTS_ version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
You can check the [automated tests](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amain) to see a list of all supported and tested versions.

### Supported OData and OpenAPI Versions

The SAP Cloud SDK supports OData v2 and v4, as well as OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0.

### Licensing

All core libraries are available as open-source npm packages in the `@sap-cloud-sdk` scope on npm under the Apache 2.0 license.
You can find the source code on GitHub.
The license of clients generated with the SAP Cloud SDK depends on the used service spec license.

## Release Schedule

The SAP Cloud SDK releases [bi-weekly](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/releases) assuming that new changes are available.

Major releases of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript usually occur every six to twelve months.
For details, check the [release policy](release-policy.mdx).

## Comparison With SAP OData Library

There is also a second open-source library for consuming OData services developed by SAP.
The [SAP OData library](https://github.com/SAP/odata-library) is developed by a different team than the SAP Cloud SDK.
It evaluates service specifications at runtime and helps you execute requests.
The table below tries to draw a line between the two open-source libraries:

| OData library                                                          | SAP Cloud SDK                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Supports JavaScript.                                                   | Supports JavaScript and TypeScript.                                                                                                                                            |
| Operates dynamically on the metadata and creates an on-the-fly-client. | Typed API clients can be [generated](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx). An [generic, untyped client](features/connectivity/generic-http-client.mdx) is also available. |
| Connectivity needs to be handled manually.                             | The SAP Cloud SDK handles [connectivity](features/connectivity/destination.mdx) on the SAP BTP for typed and untyped API clients.                                              |
