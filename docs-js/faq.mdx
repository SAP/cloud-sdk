## Generic Questions

### Is SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript Open-Source

Yes.
The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript is open-source and available under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js) and the modules on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap-cloud-sdk).

### Can I Contribute to the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript?

We are happy to review and incorporate contributions.
For details on contributing, check our [contribution guide](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How Often Do You Release a New SAP Cloud SDK Version?

We usually release [bi-weekly](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/releases).

We intend to release a new major version of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript every six to twelve months.
For details check our [release policy](release-policy.mdx).

### Should I Update With Every Release?

Yes, minor and patch releases will be backwards compatible.
We provide detailed upgrade guides for major releases, so the effort to upgrade is minimal.
Previous major releases will not receive further updates or patches, so a quick upgrade is strongly recommended.

### Which Node Versions Are Supported by the SAP Cloud SDK?

We always support the [latest _Active LTS_ version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
You can check our [automated tests](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amain) to see a list of all currently supported and tested versions.

### Can I Use Features Annotated as Beta in Production?

We **do not recommend** using APIs that are marked unstable in productive code.
We do not guarantee any API compatibility for future updates and the features might be experimental.
You can use these features to test new functionality, provide us feedback, and plan migration steps when _Beta_ features are released as _General Availability_.

### I Think I Found a Bug in the SAP Cloud SDK, What Should I Do?

Try to create a minimal, reproducible example and open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new/choose).

## OData Related Questions

### What Versions of OData Protocol Do You Support?

We support generating API clients for OData v2 and OData v4 services.
Find more details [here](features/odata/overview).

### Do You Support All OData Features?

We support most of the OData features that are exposed by SAP services.
However, the [OData specification](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) is huge and contains many features that would see rare to no use.
If you found a feature that you need, but it is not yet supported by SAP Cloud SDK, please, make a feature request via [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new/choose).

### I Receive an OData Error/Exception When Using SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript

You may see some errors while developing.
These errors are not always caused by flaws in the SAP Cloud SDK as we often see inconsistent OData protocol handling by different services.
Some of them even have known flaws for which we have workarounds.
If you can't solve your issue via debugging and experimenting, please, report your incident via [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sap-cloud-sdk) or [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new/choose).
