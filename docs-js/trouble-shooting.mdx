##Connectivity Issue

You are experiencing connectivity issues using the SAP Cloud SDK and the [error logs](features/error-handling) are not conclusive?
In such a case please follow the flowchart.
For each squared box a dedicated section gives instructions below.

### Use Minimal Example

Often the issue is related to a framework which uses the SAP Cloud SDK and not to the code itself.
Therefore, a minimal example should be added to the code to ensure the error is related to the SAP Cloud SDK.

```ts
import { executeHttpRequest } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/http-client';
import { getDestination } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity';

const destination = await getDestination({
  destinationName: YOUR_DESTINATION_NAME
});
if (destination) {
  destination.authTokens?.forEach(authToken => {
    if (authToken.error) {
      throw new Error(`Error in authToken ${authToken.error}`);
    }
  });
} else {
  throw new Error('Destination is undefined.');
}
console.log('Destination Retrieved.');
const response = await executeHttpRequest(destination, {
  method: 'get',
  url: YOUR_SERVICE_URL
});
if (!response.data) {
  throw new Error('No data returned');
}
console.log('Data Retrieved.');
```

Please replace the placeholders with the URL of your service e.g. `/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner?%24top=1`.
Please use the same service you also plan to call in production to observe authorization issues in the test case as well.
Include all `getDestination` options you are using in your real example like `useCache` or [JWT](./guides/how-to-retrieve-jwt).
Also adjust the example to your needs by adding additional log statements.

Depending on your use case you can execute this minimal example also locally to have a quicker turn around time.
This is possible when you connect to a cloud system.
If you want to do that you have to copy the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment of your application to your local process.

### Get Destination Error

You retrieved an error in the process of getting the destination.
This can have multiple reasons:

- The destination name is not correct or the destination is not present in your SAP BTP account.
- The destination has errors in the `authToken` object the destination service can not perform the token exchange.
  Adjust the configuration according to the error message.
- The destination service is missing not bound to your application.
- The destination service is missing as [dependency of your application](./tutorials/multi-tenant-application).
  This only relevant in multi-tenant applications if you make the call via a subscriber account.

If you are stuck in retrieving the destination, and you think the issue is caused by the SAP Cloud SDK, please [open an issue](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new/choose).
Please provide the information from you minimal example in the ticket.

### Fix Cloud Issues

You retrieved the destination but got an error when calling the cloud target system.
This can have multiple reasons:

- The destination contains wrong user credentials or the user does not exist in the target system.
- The user is locked in the target system
- The permission of the user are insufficient.
- The scopes of the JWT in the `authTokens` are insufficient.

If your request reaches the target system and gets rejected there the problem lies most likely not with the SAP Cloud SDK.
The error logs of the target system may provide additional information on the error.

### Activate Backend Logs

You have a problem connecting to an On-premise system via a cloud-connector and connectivity service.
Often there is an issue in the cloud-connector setup.
To see if your request reaches the backend system activate the HTTP logs:

- Go to transaction **SMICM**.
- Navigate to **GOTO->Trace Level** and set the trace level to 3 and activate HTTP logs.
- You may want to reset the log file to have no old logs **GOTO->Trace File**.
- Trigger your request.
- Remember to switch back the trace level after you send the request.
- Go to transaction **ST11** and investigate the file `dev_icm`

If you see entries related to your request your connection is working.

### Fix Connection Issues

You have not found entries in the HTTP logs.
This means your request got stuck somewhere before:

- Investigate the logs of the cloud-connector and check the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/9b6510edf4d844a28f022b3db41f3202.html) to fix problems.
- The connectivity service is not bound to your application.
- The connectivity service is missing as [dependency of your application](./tutorials/multi-tenant-application).
  This only relevant in multi-tenant applications if you make the call via a subscriber account.

If you keep experiencing problems please reach out to the SAP BTP or cloud-connector support.

### Fix On-Premise Issues

Your request reaches the backend, but is rejected there.
Usually the content of the [HTTP logs](#activate-backend-logs) should give you a hint what to do.
In the end requests get rejected for the same reasons as in the [cloud case](#fix-cloud-issues).
In addition, there are On-premise specific problems:

- The default client is not the client with your user and configuration. Set the `sap-client` explicitly on the destination.
- The principal propagation is more difficult to configure.
  If a destination with basic authentication works you know for sure you have a problem with user propagation.
- The [user mapping](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_NETWEAVER_AS_ABAP_FOR_SOH_740/d528eef3dca14679bcb47b069aa17a9d/c830fd902dc8473b9e59db1576cc784b.html?version=7.40.16&locale=en-US) is not correctly configured for principal propagation.

### Find Difference

The minimal example is working, but your real code is not.
This means the framework you are using is calling the SAP Cloud SDK in a different way then you are.
At this point you should start to [debug you application](./guides/debug-remote-app).
Try to reach the point where the `executeHttpRequest()` of the SAP Cloud SDK is called and compare the argument to the one of the minimal example.

If you found the difference, try to align it or open an issue with the framework.
