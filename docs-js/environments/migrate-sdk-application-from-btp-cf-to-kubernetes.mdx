# Migrate a Cloud Foundry Application to a Kubernetes Cluster

This guide details the steps necessary to migrate an application from Cloud Foundry to a Gardener-based Kubernetes cluster.
The samples repository contains the [Kubernetes application](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/samples/k8s-sample-application) that will be used in this guide.

### Prerequisites

- Install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
- Install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and ensure access to a publicly reachable Docker repository.
  :::info

  A Kubernetes cluster uses a secret to authenticate with a container registry to pull an image.
  For that, you will need to [configure a secret in your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line):

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=YOUR_DOCKER_SERVER --docker-username=YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME --docker-password=YOUR_DOCKER_PASSWORD --docker-email=YOUR_DOCKER_EMAIL
  ```

  :::

- Use [Gardener](https://dashboard.garden.canary.k8s.ondemand.com/) for a Kubernetes Cluster with a load balancer enabled.
  :::info
  This guide assumes you have created a cluster via Gardener dashboard and have it set up for cluster access.
  We also recommend to have an **Ingress** set up that exposes the application to the internet.

  :::

- Install [`helm`](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), a package manager for Kubernetes.
- Install the [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator/) in the cluster.
  :::info
  For production environments, you need a reliable way of configuring which services are running in your cluster.
  To achieve that, leverage the SAP BTP Service Operator.
  This guide assumes you have the SAP BTP Service Operator installed in your cluster.
  If not, follow the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator#setup).
  :::

### Create and Bind SAP BTP Services

Since the service operator is running in your cluster, you can create services just like you would do in SAP BTP CF, but instead of the SAP BTP cockpit, you'll use YAML service definitions.
For this guide, we'll assume the application uses two services:

- Destination Service
- XSUAA Service

#### Bind the Destination Service

1. Create `yaml` files for the destination service instance and binding:

<OperatorDestinationService />

2. Install the configuration using the commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f operator-destination-service.yml
kubectl apply -f operator-destination-binding.yml
```

This should create a Kubernetes secret named `operator-destination-service`.
This secret will contain the actual service binding information.

3. Monitor the status via `kubectl describe ServiceInstance operator-destination-service`.

#### Bind the XSUAA Service

Create `yaml` files for the XSUAA service instance and binding:

<OperatorXsuaaService />

2. Repeat steps 2 and 3 from the [previous section](#bind-the-destination-service) for the XSUAA service.
   Replace `destination` with `xsuaa`.

We will see how to mount the created secrets into the file system of the application in the [deployment configuration](#create-a-deployment-configuration) step.

:::info
Notice that the `metadata -> name` property can be anything you want.
In this case, it's `operator-destination-service`.
Make sure it matches exactly to the `spec -> serviceInstanceName` field in the binding.
:::

## Deploy to Kubernetes

This section covers the following:

1. How to deploy an application to Kubernetes.
2. How to consume the bound services in the application from within the cluster.

### Containerize the Application

Create a `Dockerfile` defining a container for the application.
Then it can be deployed to one or more Kubernetes Pods.

<DockerFile />

Compile and push the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t <YOUR_REPO>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>:<YOUR_TAG> .
docker push <YOUR_REPO>/<YOUR_IMAGE_NAME>:<YOUR_TAG>
```

### Create a Deployment Configuration

Create a `deployment.yml` file as shown below:

```yaml title="app/deployment.yml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sdkjs-e2e
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sdkjs-e2e
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sdkjs-e2e
          image: <YOUR_REPO>/k8s-e2e-app:latest
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: '256Mi'
              cpu: '500m'
            limits:
              memory: '512Mi'
              cpu: '1000m'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          volumeMounts:
            - name: destination-volume
              mountPath: '/etc/secrets/sapcp/destination/operator-destination-service'
              readOnly: true
            - name: xsuaa-volume
              mountPath: '/etc/secrets/sapcp/xsuaa/operator-xsuaa-service'
              readOnly: true
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: regcred
      volumes:
        - name: destination-volume
          secret:
            secretName: operator-destination-service
        - name: xsuaa-volume
          secret:
            secretName: operator-xsuaa-service
```

The file contains the following data:

- **Resources definition**: The `requests` field specifies the CPU and memory requirements of the app.
  Additionally, the resources can scale based on the values provided in the `limits` field.
- **Service bindings**: the volumes `destination-volume` and `xsuaa-volume` reference the secrets (service bindings).
  The volumes are mounted into the file system of your application at a specific path by adding them to the list of `volumeMounts` in the `containers` section.
  :::info
  The path convention is provided by the [xsenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/xsenv) library.
  :::
- **Container image and registry secrets**: `regcred` secret used by the `imagePullSecrets` config contains your registry credentials that you bound as a secret (in case the image was pushed to a private repository).

Deploy the application by running the command:

`kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`

### Access Your Application

To access the application, you have two options.
Either expose it to the internet directly or port-forward to your local machine.

#### Local Connection

Run the command `kubectl port-forward deployment YOUR_DEPLOYMENT :3000` on your local machine to enable port forwarding.
Your application will listen to port 3000.
Kubernetes finds an available port on your local machine and forwards port 3000 of your deployment to it.
Make a call to the application via a provided link.

#### Internet Facing Connection

:::danger
Exposing an application this way is good only for testing.
**Don't use it in production.**
:::

Run the command below to expose the application to the internet.
It will use the cluster's IP address and the port the application listens on.

`kubectl expose deployment YOUR_DEPLOYMENT --type="LoadBalancer"`

### Configure TLS and Obtain a Domain in SAP Gardener

If you want to expose your cluster under a domain name with TLS, check out the steps below or follow the official Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/) for a general setup.

:::info **Prerequisite**
Enable the NGINX Ingress add-on for your SAP Gardener cluster.
:::

The fastest way to enable TLS and obtain a domain for your application is to create a Service for your Deployment, and an Ingress to handle the routing.
Create a Service that contains your Deployment and the port you want to expose as shown in the example below:

```yaml title="app/k8s-e2e-service.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: sdkjs-e2e
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 3000
```

Check your shoot cluster's `kubeconfig.yaml` for the configured DNS, which should be located in your Gardener project's dashboard, under the YAML tab.
It should be a field that looks like this:

```yaml
spec:
  dns:
    domain: cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
```

Since the NGINX Ingress is enabled, all domains have to follow the pattern `*.ingress.YOUR_DNS`, for example:

```yaml
e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
```

This is how the Ingress configuration file should look like:

```yaml title="ingress.yml"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-ingress
  annotations:
    cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com # - "<YOUR_DNS>"
        - e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com # - "*.ingress.<YOUR_DNS>"
      secretName: secret-tls
  rules:
    - host: e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: sdkjs-e2e-svc
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

Notice how the Ingress uses the annotation `cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed`, which is important so that SAP Gardener manages TLS.

The `spec.tls.hosts` config exposes 2 domains.
The first one is your default domain, limited to a maximum of 64 characters.
Other domains can be any size, but should follow the Ingress pattern.

The field `secretName: secret-tls` in the configuration implies that all TLS certificates will be saved by SAP Gardener.
Finally, look at how to serve the Service at the root of your subdomain.
This way the Service is exposed to the internet using TLS.

### Expose the Application using approuter

In the next steps, you will configure and deploy an approuter so that only users authenticated by your identity provider can access the application endpoints.
For that, create a [simple application](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/samples/k8s-sample-application/approuter) that uses the @sap/approuter.

1. Package the application router as a docker image so that it can run in Kubernetes, refer to the [documentation](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/03/sap-application-router/) for configuration details.

2. Create a Kubernetes Deployment and a Kubernetes Service to run and expose the application router.

```yaml title="approuter/deployment.yml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: approuter
  labels:
    app: approuter
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: approuter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: approuter
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: <YOUR_REPO>/k8s-approuter:latest
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: '256Mi'
              cpu: '250m'
            limits:
              memory: '512Mi'
              cpu: '500m'
          name: approuter
          volumeMounts:
            - name: xsuaa-volume
              mountPath: '/etc/secrets/sapcp/xsuaa/operator-xsuaa-service'
              readOnly: true
          env:
            - name: PORT
              value: '5000'
            - name: destinations
              value: '[{"name":"backend", "url":"http://sdkjs-e2e-svc:8080/", "forwardAuthToken": true}]'
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: regcred
      volumes:
        - name: xsuaa-volume
          secret:
            secretName: operator-xsuaa-service
```

It references the application running in your cluster.
Instead of an Ingress endpoint, it directly points to the Service.
This is possible because the application router runs in your cluster and can therefore use the Kubernetes native Service discovery.

The Service configuration:

```yaml title="approuter/approuter-service.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: approuter-svc
  labels:
    app: approuter
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: approuter
```

4. Finally, configure the Ingress to create a session cookie that is consumed by the application router.
   Set the `backend.service.name` to `approuter-svc` to point the Ingress to the `approuter` Service.
   To secure your application, remove all previous routes that pointed to your application's endpoints and only expose them through the application router.
   For that, specify the Service names in your approuter destinations' configuration and remove the rules you previously created for these endpoints in the Ingress.

Depending on the Ingress controller, you have to use different annotations.
An Ingress that only exposes the application router and uses the annotations is shown in the following example:

```yaml title="ingress.yml"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: 'cookie'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: '600'
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: 'JSESSIONID'
    cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
        - e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
      secretName: secret-tls
  rules:
    - host: e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: approuter-svc
                port:
                  number: 8080
```
