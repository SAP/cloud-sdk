## Overview

In this part of the tutorial, you will do the following:

- Extend your starter NestJS application by adding a custom route.
- Call the business partner service of SAP S/4HANA Cloud using the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.
- Manage destinations centrally during development (optional).

## Add a Custom Route

Initially, the app contains a basic controller with a single route that returns the string "Hello World!".
We will add another route for `business-parters` that will list all available business partners.

Create a new controller by executing the command:

```shell
nest g controller business-partners
```

This will create a folder `business-partners` in the `src/` directory containing the controller `business-partners.controller.ts`.

```ts
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('business-partners')
export class BusinessPartnersController {}
```

The `@Controller(business-partners)` decorator marks the class `BusinessPartnerController` as a controller (i.e. a thing that handles requests).
Next, we will add a method `getBusinessPartners` with a `@Get('')` decorator.
This will tell Nest to create a handler for this endpoint for HTTP requests.

```ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('business-partners')
export class BusinessPartnersController {
  @Get()
  getBusinessPartners() {
    return 'We will implement this in a minute.';
  }
}
```

Notice that we did not add any path information in the decorator.
Nest will map GET `/business-partners` requests to this handler.

For the controller to work, you need to include it in the `controllers` array within the `@Module()` decorator in `app.module.ts`.
The generate command updates the `app.module.ts` automatically and looks like this:

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { BusinessPartnersController } from './business-partners/business-partners.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController, BusinessPartnersController],
  providers: [AppService]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

If you've started your application with the following command in the previous tutorial, it should detect the change and restart automatically.

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

If you've terminated your application, you can restart it by running the start command again.
Now, calling http://localhost:8080/business-partners should return our placeholder string.

## Import Service Entities

To use the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript to make a call to an OData service, add the client library to your dependencies.
For this tutorial, we are using the client library for the business partner service, `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service`.
Install it with the following command:

```shell
npm install @sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service@latest
```

:::note
The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript offers packages for each OData service exposed by SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
You can find a list of these services in the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/).
:::

## Execute an OData Request

Next, we will create a service that will be responsible for fetching the business partners.
To create a service class `business-partners.service.ts`, execute:

```shell
nest g service business-partners
```

This creates a basic class inside `src/business-partners/` folder.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class BusinessPartnersService {}
```

The service is also registered in the `provider` array within the `@Module()` decorator in `app.module.ts`.

```ts
@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController, BusinessPartnersController],
  providers: [AppService, BusinessPartnersService],
})
```

To import the service function and entity exported by the client library, add the following line to the top of the service class.

```ts
import {
  businessPartnerService,
  BusinessPartner
} from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';
```

Create a function `getAllBusinessPartners`.
Get the API for the entity you want to make a call to in your application.
In this tutorial, we are using the `businessPartnerApi` of the business partner service.
Unpack the API object from the service function using [JavaScript Object Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

Depending on the target system you are connecting to, the destination configuration can vary:

{ label: 'Mock Server', value: 'mock-server'},{ label: 'SAP S/4HANA Cloud System', value: 's4hana-cloud'},{ label: 'SAP API Business Hub Sandbox', value: 'api-hub-sandbox'}]}>

<TabItem value="mock-server">

```ts
async getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return await businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/',
  });
}
```

  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return await businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    url: '<URI of your SAP S/4HANA Cloud System>',
    username: '<USERNAME>',
    password: '<PASSWORD>'
  });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api-hub-sandbox">

async getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return await businessPartnerApi
    .requestBuilder()
    .getAll()
    .addCustomHeaders({ APIKey: '<YOUR-API-KEY>' })
    .execute({
      url: 'https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud'
    });
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As network requests are asynchronous by nature, the return value of this function is a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to a list of business partners `(Promise<BusinessPartner[]>)`.

Now that we have a service class to retrieve business partners, let's use it in the `BusinessPartnersController`.
The `BusinessPartnersService` is injected through the class constructor:

```ts
import { Controller, Get, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';
import { BusinessPartnersService } from './business-partners.service';

@Controller('business-partners')
export class BusinessPartnersController {
  constructor(private businessPartnerService: BusinessPartnersService) {}

  @Get()
  async getBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
    return await this.businessPartnerService
      .getAllBusinessPartners()
      .catch(error => {
        throw new HttpException(
          `Failed to get business partners - ${error.message}`,
          500
        );
      });
  }
}
```

Nest will handle the `Promise` we return automatically.
We add a `.catch` handler to specify how errors are handled (otherwise it would only show an internal server error when something goes wrong).
Reload the http://localhost:8080/business-partners URL to retrieve a list of business partners.

Congratulations, you just made your first call with the SAP Cloud SDK!

## Manage Destinations Centrally (Optional)

To avoid repeating your destination configuration for every request execution, you can set a destinations environment variable to manage your destinations.
In `Node.js` applications, it is common to use a `.env` file to maintain such environment variables for a given project.
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and define the destinations environment variable as follows:

```ts
destinations = [
  {
    name: '<DESTINATIONNAME>',
    url: '<URL to your system>',
    username: '<USERNAME>',
    password: '<PASSWORD>'
  }
];
```

:::note
Every environment variable in the `.env` file has to be defined on one line.
You can add more destinations to the array.
:::

This is what it would look like for the mock server:

```ts
destinations = [{ name: 'MockServer', url: 'http://localhost:3000' }];
```

:::caution
Please do not use this approach in production and also include the .env file in your .gitignore list, so that it is not checked in.
:::

Now that we have defined our destinations, we need to make sure that they are available in our process.
For this, we use the `config` package provided by `nest.js`. You can install it with the following command:

```shell
npm install @nestjs/config
```

To load the environment variables defined in the `.env` file, we need to add the `ConfigModule` provided by the `config` package to the application's `@Module` definition.
Open `app.module.ts` and update it with the following code:

```ts
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
  controllers: [AppController, BusinessPartnersController],
  providers: [AppService, BusinessPartnersService],
})
```

`ConfigModule` is imported from the `config` package and in we add it to the module's `imports`.
If no arguments are passed to the `forRoot()` method, the `.env` file has to be located in the project root.
For details on the possible configuration see the [nest documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration).
To reference a destination in the request execution, replace the URL with a destinationName - `MockServer` in our example:

```ts
async getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return await businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    destinationName: 'MockServer'
  });
}
```

## Final Code Review

In this tutorial, you added a new custom route to your application.
Using the SAP Cloud SDK, you executed an OData request to fetch a list of business partners.
You configured the destinations environment variable using a `.env` file.

Here are the code files discussed on this page, if you are using the mock server:
