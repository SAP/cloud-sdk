## Overview

In this part of the tutorial, you will do the following:

- Deploy your application to Cloud Foundry in SAP Business Technology Platform
- Configure a destination in the SAP Business Technology cockpit
- Consume the destination in your application

## Deploy Application to Cloud Foundry

To deploy your application, you need to add a `manifest.yml` file to the root directory.
It is a deployment descriptor file for Cloud Foundry environment in SAP BTP.
The file should look like this:

```YAML
applications:
  - name: <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
    path: .
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: npm run start:prod
    random-route: true
```

where `<YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>` is replaced by the name you specified when initializing the project.

- The specified `path` instructs Cloud Foundry to upload all the files from the `dist/` folder.
- The command specified under the `command` attribute tells the buildpack what command to issue to start the application.

Next, you need to login to Cloud Foundry in SAP Business Technology Platform using the cf CLI.
First, you need to set an API endpoint.
The exact URL of this API endpoint depends on the region your _subaccount_ is in.
Open the [SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/) and navigate to the subaccount you are planning to deploy your application to.
Click on _Overview_ on the left and you can see the URL of the API endpoint.

<img

  width="100%"
/>

Copy the URL and paste it into the following command in your command line:

```shell
cf api https://api.cf.<region>.hana.ondemand.com
cf login
```

The `cf login` command will prompt you for your _username_ and your _password_.
Should you have more than one organization or space, you will also have to select those.

Finally, if you have logged in successfully, it is time to build and deploy your application.
The `package.json` contains a few scripts that can be used for this purpose.
In productive environments you would transpile the application from TypeScript to JavaScript using the `build` script and deploy the application using:

```shell
cf push
```

Dependencies will be installed automatically when deploying to Cloud Foundry.
The Cloud Foundry CLI will automatically pick up the `manifest.yml` of the project when deploying your application.

When everything works as expected, you should get an output that looks something like this:

```shell
Waiting for app to start...

name:              <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
requested state:   started
routes:            <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
last uploaded:     Thu 21 Mar 14:05:32 CET 2019
stack:             cflinuxfs3
buildpacks:        nodejs

type:            web
instances:       1/1
memory usage:    256M
start command:   node index.js
     state     since                  cpu    memory        disk           details
#0   running   2019-03-21T13:05:47Z   0.0%   16M of 256M   126.8M of 1G
```

The application will be running at the `routes` URL.
You can also make sure that the application works correctly by running the start command, this command can be different from the one shown above.

Should the application not work for whatever reason, you can call the following command to access the logs:

```Shell
cf logs <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME> --recent
```

## Deploy the Business Partner Mock Server (Optional)

:::note
If you have access to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, you can skip this step.
:::

If you have used the [OData Mock Service](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-book/tree/mock-server) for the business partner API in the previous tutorial, you will now also have to deploy it to Cloud Foundry.
Navigate to the mock server project's root folder, which already contains a `manifest.yml`, and run:

```shell
cf push
```

Make sure that your mock server and Node.js are up to date.
When the server has been pushed successfully, cf CLI will output the route where the server can be reached.
Copy this route, as you will need it in the next step.

## Configure Destination

Now that you have deployed your application, you need to configure a destination in the Cloud Cockpit so that it can be used by your application.

Start by opening the [Cloud Cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome) in your browser and logging in.

Next, navigate to your respective subaccount (in case of a trial account it should be called _trial_).
In the menu bar on the left, there should be a section _Connectivity_ with an entry called _Destinations_.
Click _Destinations_.
On the page that opens, click _New Destination_ and fill in the details below.

<img
  alt="SAP BTP Cockpit Subaccount Destinations"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/sap_cloud_platform_cockpit.png')}
  width="100%"
/>

For _Name_, choose a name that describes your system.
This tutorial will go with `MockServer`.

If you use the business partner mock server, for URL enter the URL that you have saved from the previous step and use `NoAuthentication` for _Authentication_.
If you use an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, enter the system URL in the URL field and choose `BasicAuthentication` as the authentication type.
This will make the fields _User_ and _Password_ appear.
Enter here the credentials of a technical user for your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.

## Bind Destination Service

To allow the application to use the destination you have just configured, you need to bind instances of the destination and the XSUAA services to your application.

To create an instance of the destination service, execute the following command:

```shell
cf create-service destination lite my-destination
```

This tells Cloud Foundry to create an instance of the destination service with service plan _lite_ and make it accessible under the name `my-destination`.
You can now use the name to bind this service to your application.
To do this, open your `manifest.yml` and add a section called `services`, under which you can then add the name of the created service.

The resulting `manifest.yml` should look like this:

```YAML
applications:
  - name: <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
    path: .
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: npm run start:prod
    random-route: true
    services:
      - my-destination
```

Secondly, you need an instance of the XSUAA service.
The XSUAA service is responsible for issuing access tokens that are necessary to talk to other services, like the destination service.
For this service, you will need a bit of extra configuration in the form of a configuration file.
Create a file called `xs-security.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "xsappname": "<YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>",
  "tenant-mode": "shared"
}
```

The value for `xsappname` again has to be unique across the whole of Cloud Foundry in SAP Business Technology Platform.
Make sure to choose a unique name or prefix.
Now, execute the following command:

```shell
cf create-service xsuaa application my-xsuaa -c xs-security.json
```

As before, add the newly created services to the services section of your `manifest.yml`.

```YAML
services:
      - my-destination
      - my-xsuaa
```

Finally, you need to adapt the `getAllBusinessPartners()` function in `business-partner.service.ts` to use the destination defined in the SAP BTP Cockpit.

The function now looks like this:

```ts
async getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return await businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    destinationName: 'MockServer'
  });
}
```

In the snippet, the parameter of the `execute()` method is replaced with an object whose key `destinationName` refers to the name of the destination you defined earlier.
If you followed this [step](./execute-an-odata-request#manage-destinations-centrally-optional) in the previous tutorial, your code will already refer to the correct `destinationName`.
If you chose a different name than `MockServer`, make sure to use it here accordingly.

Now you can recompile and redeploy the application.
When you now call the `/business-partner` route of your app, the Business Partners will be retrieved from the defined destination.

## Final Code Review

In this tutorial, you deployed your application to Cloud Foundry.
You configured a new destination in the Cloud Cockpit.
You created instances of destination and XSUAA services to consume the configured destination.

Here are the code files discussed on this page:

<Tabs groupId="code-files" defaultValue="manifest" values={[{ label: 'manifest.yml', value: 'manifest'}, { label: 'xs-security.json', value: 'xs-security'}]}>

<TabItem value="manifest">

```YAML
applications:
  - name: <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
    path: .
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: npm run start:prod
    random-route: true
    services:
      - my-destination
      - my-xsuaa
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="xs-security">

```json
{
  "xsappname": "<YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>",
  "tenant-mode": "shared"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
