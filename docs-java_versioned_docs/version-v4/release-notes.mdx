## Should I update?

We highly recommend regularly updating to the latest SAP Cloud SDK version.
It will help you:

- Ensure access to the latest SAP Cloud SDK features
- Keep up with the latest changes in SAP Cloud Platform
- Update client libraries giving access to latest SAP services on SAP Cloud Platform and SAP S/4HANA
- Protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

### The SAP Cloud SDK v3 and v4 for Java is Deprecated

:::info Update to the SAP Cloud SDK v5

Version 3.x and 4.x of the SAP Cloud SDK for Java has reached its end of life.
As a consequence, there won't be any updates to the SAP Cloud SDK version 3 or 4 - not even security fixes.
To continue using the latest features outlined in the release notes below, please [update to **the SAP Cloud SDK v4**](/docs/java/v4/guides/4.0-upgrade) and [to **the SAP Cloud SDK v5**](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/guides/5.0-upgrade-steps).
