## 3.76.0 - October 31, 2022

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.76.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/d36e6a93f11b48bd920453bed2149bd3/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Improvements

- The naming of the destination retrieval strategy (`SUBSCRIBER_THEN_PROVIDER`) both in the `ScpCfDestinationLoader` as well as in the `ScpNeoDestinationLoader` did not behave as the name implied, as it was taking the current tenant, which might, due to misconfiguration, also be the Provider Tenant for the first destination retrieval attempt.
  This is now fixed by the following steps:
  - Deprecation of the unclear `SUBSCRIBER_THEN_PROVIDER` strategy
  - Adding a new strategy `CURRENT_TENANT_THEN_PROVIDER`, which will not perform a second retrieval attempt in case the current tenant is already the provider
- The naming of the `ScpNeoDestinationRetrievalStrategy` (`ALWAYS_SUBSCRIBER`) in the `ScpNeoDestinationLoader` did not behave as the name implied, as it was taking the current tenant, which might, due to misconfiguration, also be the Provider Tenant.
  This is now fixed by the following steps:
  - Deprecation of the unclear `ALWAYS_SUBSCRIBER` strategy
  - Alternative strategy keeping the same behavior: `CURRENT_TENANT`
  - Adding a new strategy `ONLY_SUBSCRIBER` which actively enforces that the current tenant is not the provider tenant
