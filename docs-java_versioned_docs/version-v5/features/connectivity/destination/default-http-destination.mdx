# The `DefaultHttpDestination` API

The `DefaultHttpDestination` is the default implementation of the `HttpDestination` interface and comes as part of the [cloudplatform-connectivity artifact](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/cloudplatform-connectivity).
Besides being the default implementation, it is also **the only** one that comes with the SAP Cloud SDK. <br />
This is noteworthy as earlier versions of the SAP Cloud SDK used to come with various implementations.
