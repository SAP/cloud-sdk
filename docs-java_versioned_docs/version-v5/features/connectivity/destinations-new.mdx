## About Destinations

A **destination** is an abstraction of a real system or service that applications may want to connect to.
It is a representation of the connection details, such as the URL, authentication, proxy settings, and HTTP headers.
The **destination** concept is an integral part of the SAP Cloud SDK for Java.

## Accessing Destinations

The SAP Cloud SDK offers the following APIs for accessing destinations from various sources:

* [The `DestinationAccessor` API](destination/destination-accessor)
  * Retrieving destinations from the [Destination Service on Cloud Foundry](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_CF_Connectivity_Destination/overview)
  * Retrieving destinations from the application's environment
* [The `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API](destination/service-binding-destination-loader)
  * Converting [Service Bindings](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access/wiki/Fundamentals#service-binding) into destinations
* [The `DefaultHttpDestination` API](destination/default-http-destination)
  * Creating destinations from scratch in code
  * Modifying existing destinations in code

## Using Destinations

Once a `Destination` has been retrieved, it can be used to connect to the system or service it represents.
This is done by converting the given `Destination` into an HTTP client, which is then used to send requests to the system or service.

### For OData and OpenApi Services

While the `Destination` to HTTP client conversion [can be done explicitly](#for-other-services) to connect to any system or service, the SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient integrations in generated [OData](../odata/vdm-generator) and [OpenApi](../rest/generate-rest-client) clients.

<Tabs defaultValue="odatav4" values={[ { label: "OData V4 Example", value: "odatav4" }, { label: "OData V2 Example", value: "odatav2"}, { label: "OpenApi Example", value: "openapi" }]}>

<TabItem value="odatav4">

```java
Destination myDestination;
SomeODataV4Service myService;

var serviceResponse = myService.getAllEntities().execute(myDestination);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="odatav2">

```java
Destination myDestination;
SomeODataV2Service myService;

var serviceResponse = myService.getAllEntities().executeRequest(myDestination);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="openapi">

```java
Destination myDestination;

var myService = new SomeOpenApiService(myDestination);
var serviceResponse = myService.entitiesGet();
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When running code as above, the SAP Cloud SDK internally takes care of converting the provided `Destination` into a suitable HTTP client.
This process is fully transparent to the user and has proven to be sufficient for almost all use cases.

### For Other Services

If the [above approach](#for-odata-and-openapi-services) is not applicable, the `Destination` to HTTP client conversion can be done explicitly as [described here](http-client).
