  Please refer to the [Upgrade Guide](../guides/5.0-upgrade-steps.mdx) for the full list of module changes.

### API Changes

#### Changes to the overall Destination API:

- Both `HttpDestination` as well as `HttpDestinationProperties` are now sub-types of `Destination` for improved compatibility with the Cloud SDK APIs.
- The `Destination#decorate` method has been removed without replacement.
- The public constructor of `DefaultHttpDestination` has been replaced with a static factory method `DefaultHttpDestination#fromProperties`.
  - We also added some extra static factory methods (`DefaultHttpDestination#fromMap` and `DefaultHttpDestination#fromDestination`) for convenience.
- The public constructor of `DefaultDestination` has been replaced with a static factory method `DefaultHttpDestination#fromMap`.
  - We also added an extra static factory method `DefaultHttpDestination#fromProperties` for convenience.
- The `DefaultHttpDestination.Builder` has been modified in the following ways:
  - The `user(String)` and `password(String)` methods have been replaced with `basicCredentials(String, String)`.
  - Using any overload of `basicCredentials` will now automatically set the `AuthenticationType` to `BASIC_AUTHENTICATION`.
  - Using `proxyConfiguration(ProxyConfiguration)` will now throw an `IllegalArgumentException` in case the contained `Credentials` are not supported. Supported types are `BearerCredentials` and `NoCredentials`.
- Changed the following `DestinationPropertyKey` instances:
  - `AUTH_TYPE`: `authentication` -> `Authentication`
  - `CERTIFICATES`: `certificates` -> `cloudsdk.certificates`
  - `AUTH_TOKENS`: `authTokens` -> `cloudsdk.authTokens`
  - These changes are most relevant for users who are **not** already using these constant `DestinationPropertyKey` instances but instead retrieved properties from `DestinationProperties` (and sub-types) using the `get(String, Function)` method.
- The deprecated `ClientCredentialsHttpDestination` has been removed in favor of the improved `OAuth2DestinationBuilder`.
  - The `OAuth2DestinationBuilder` has been changed to allow for setting arbitrary destination properties after the OAuth2 configuration has been set.
  - The `.withProperties(..)` aspect of the builder has been replaced with `.withProperty(..)`.
- The `BearerCredentials` behavior has been adjusted slightly: The `getToken()` method no longer just returns the value passed in via the constructor but instead is now guaranteed to **NOT** contain the prefix `"Bearer "`.
  To compensate this change, the `#getHttpHeaderValue()` method has been added, which is guaranteed to contain the `"Bearer "` prefix.

#### Changes related to the BTP Destination Service:

- The `ScpCfDestination` and `ScpCfHttpDestination` classes are replaced by the baseline `Destination` and `DefaultHttpDestination` implementations.
- The `ScpCfDestinationLoader` has been renamed to `DestinationService`.
  All related classes have been renamed similarly:
  - `ScpCfDestinationRetrievalStrategy` -> `DestinationServiceRetrievalStrategy`
    - The deprecated `CURRENT_TENANT_THEN_PROVIDER` has been removed.
  - `ScpCfDestinationTokenExchangeStrategy` -> `DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy`
  - `ScpCfDestinationServiceV1Response` -> `DestinationServiceV1Response`
- Removed the following elements from enum `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.AuthenticationType`:
  - `APP_TO_APP_SSO`
  - `INTERNAL_SYSTEM_AUTHENTICATION`

#### Changes to HTTP clients:

- The `HttpClientAccessor` and `ApacheHttpClient5Accessor` classes are generalised to accept `Destination` instances, making invocations to `.asHttp()` superfluous when obtaining HTTP clients.
- The `getSslContext()` method was removed from the `CloudPlatform` interface and the implementation was moved to the modules `connectivity-apache-httpclient4` and `connectivity-apache-httpclient5`.

#### Changes to Multi-Tenancy APIs:

- The public constructor of `DefaultPrincipal` now only accepts a String argument for `principalId`.
- The `PrincipalFacade` of the `PrincipalAccessor` will default to `DefaultPrincipalFacade` in the case that a facade cannot be found.
- The `RequestHeaderContainer` no longer splits header values.
- The `ODataRequestResult` no longer splits header values.
- The `AuthTokenFacade` of the `AuthTokenAccessor` will default to `DefaultAuthTokenFacade`
- The `TenantFacade` of the `TenantAccessor` will default to `DefaultTenantFacade`
- The `TenantWithSubdomain#getSubdomain` is now nullable.

#### Changes to the Cloud Platform API:

- The `CloudPlatform` interface and all related classes have been removed.
  In particular, the following classes have been removed:
  - `ScpCfCloudPlatform` and `ScpNeoCloudPlatform`
  - `CloudPlatformAccessor` and `CloudPlatformFacade`

### Maven Module Changes

- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:scp-cf` has been deprecated. Please use `com.sap.cloud.sdk:sdk-core` instead.
- All classes related to the Apache Http Client 4 have been moved from `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:cloudplatform-connectivity` to a new module `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:connectivity-apache-httpclient4`.
- All classes related to the Apache Http Client 5 have been moved from `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:apache-httpclient5` to `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:connectivity-apache-httpclient5`.
- All classes related to Resilience4j have been moved from `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:resilience4j` to `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:resilience4j`.
- All classes related to OAuth authorization flows have been moved into a new module `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:connectivity-oauth2`.
- The `cloudplatform-connectivity-scp-cf` module got renamed to `connectivity-destination-service`.
  - To prevent breaking changes with the renamed module the `cloudplatform-connectivity-scp-cf` module is still available as a dependency, but it is empty and just contains a reference to the new module `connectivity-destination-service`.
- All modules related to the SAP BTP Neo Environment have been removed.
- All modules with suffixes `-scp-cf` have been merged into their respective baseline modules:
  - `tenant-scp-cf` has been merged into `tenant`
  - `security-scp-cf` has been merged into `security`
- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:servlet` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:security-servlet` have been removed.
- All deprecated pre-generated clients for OData and OpenAPI have been removed:
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-all`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata-onpremise`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata-v4`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata-v4-onpremise`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:scp-workflow-cf`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:btp-business-rules`

### Major Dependency Changes

- Upgrade the [SAP BTP Security Libraries](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library) (`com.sap.cloud.security`) from `2.14.2` to `3.3.0`.
- Upgrade [Spring](https://spring.io) (`org.springframework`) from `5.3.29` to `6.1.1`.
- Upgrade [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org) (`org.slf4j`) from `1.7.36` to `2.0.9`.
- Upgrade [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) (`com.github.ben-manes.caffeine`) from `2.9.3` to `3.1.8`.
- Change the servlet integration to the [Jakarta](https://jakarta.ee) namespace (`jakarta.servlet`).
- The overall dependency footprint of the SAP Cloud SDK has been reduced significantly.
  - This also means that some dependencies have been removed from the `sdk-bom`.

### Other Improvements

- The `Destination#asHttp()` and `Destination#asRfc()` methods no longer always return a new instance of `HttpDestination` and `RfcDestination` if the current objects is already a `HttpDestination` or `RfcDestination` respectively.
- The OData, OpenAPI and SOAP APIs are generalised to accept instances of `Destination`, making invocations to `.asHttp()` superfluous when executing OData or REST requests.
  - OData V2 and OpenAPI clients need to be re-generated to adjust for this change.
- `Destination#asHttp()` no longer throws an exception in case the `Destination` originates from the Destination service and the attached auth token contains an error.
  Instead, an exception will be thrown upon invoking the `getHeaders()` method, for example, during request execution.
- Loading a `Destination` from the BTP Destination service will now:
  - No longer eagerly evaluate authentication tokens or On-Premise related headers (if applicable).
    Instead, those will be evaluated lazily upon request execution.
    As a consequence, the `getHeaders` method might now throw an exception if resolving (on-premise) authentication information fails.
  - Throw an exception if the tenant changed in between loading and using the destination to execute requests.
  - Throw an exception if any of the attached certificates isn't valid.
- Removed the `javax.inject.Named` annotation from code generated with any of the OData generators (v2, v4).

### Fixed Issues

- Fixed a bug where an `Authorization` header was attached multiple times to outgoing HTTP requests under some circumstances
- Fixed an issue where the `DestinationType` of an `DefaultHttpDestination` could be changed to anything but `DestinationType.HTTP`
- Fixed an issue with custom GSON serialization of OpenAPI generated classes having unexpected `customFieldNames` properties in JSON payload.
