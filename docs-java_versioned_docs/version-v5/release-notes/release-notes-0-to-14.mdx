## 5.0.0

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:5.0.0)

### Known Issues

### Compatibility Notes

- All `Destination` implementations have been removed with `DefaultHttpDestination` and `DefaultRfcDestination` being the only exceptions.
  The slightly different behaviors of the previous implementation have been consolidated and merged in the corresponding default implementations.
  Therefore, users shouldn't notice any difference when using the regular `DestinationAccessor` API.
- Public APIs that previously required a specific sub-type of `Destination` (or `DestinationProperties`) have been changed to simply accept an instance of `Destination`.
  That way, application are no longer required to cast `Destination` instances retrieved via the `DestinationAccessor`.

### New Functionality

### Improvements

- The `Destination#asHttp()` and `Destination#asRfc()` methods no longer always return a new instance of `HttpDestination` and `RfcDestination` if the current objects is already a `HttpDestination` or `RfcDestination` respectively.
- `Destination#asHttp()` no longer throws an exception in case the `Destination` orignates from the Destination service and the attached auth token contains an error.
  Instead, an exception will be thrown upon invoking the `getHeaders()` method, for example, during request execution.
