This document outlines how to adjust a Spring Boot project to use WAR deployment (also known as traditional deployment).
The traditional deployment of Spring helps overcome exceptions related to the SAP JCo library.

## Modern and Traditional Spring Deployment

Traditionally, Java projects based on Spring were built as war files which had to be deployed to standalone application servers, such as Tomcat.
With the rise of Spring Boot, the target file type changed to jar files where the application server is already built in.
The advantage of that modern deployment form is that the application can be started directly without the need to administer a complex application server.

## Target Projects of This Guide

This guide is applicable to all Spring-based Java projects which use the modern deployment of Spring as jar file.
That comprises in the first place any project using the [new CAP stack](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) as well as the [Spring Boot Maven archetype](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.archetypes/scp-cf-spring) of the SAP Cloud SDK.

The problem with the modern deployment is that the [SAP Java Connector](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/jco.html) library cannot be used when the application gets deployed as jar file.
That results in runtime exceptions like `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sap/conn/jco/JCoException`.

To overcome this problem, we'll outline how to adjust your project to leverage the traditional Spring deployment instead.

## Use Traditional Spring Deployment

Perform the following steps to switch your project from using the modern to the traditional Spring deployment.

### Change Maven Packaging

In your `pom.xml`, change the packaging setting from `jar` to `war`.

```xml
<!-- before: -->
<!-- <packaging>jar</packaging> -->

<!-- after: -->
<packaging>war</packaging>
```

:::tip Use the right `pom.xml`

When your project uses multiple Maven modules, you need to choose the `pom.xml` that contains your application code.
For instance, in a CAP project use the `pom.xml` of the `srv` module.

:::

### Add Maven WAR Plugin

Add the Maven WAR plugin to the `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
    <!-- use latest version here -->
    <version>3.3.2</version>
    <configuration>
      <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Adjust Dependency Scopes

The WAR file will be deployed into an a Tomcat application container.
Thus we no longer need to include the dependencies that are now provided by the container.

Adjust your dependency management section to contain the following entries:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
    <!-- Cloud SDK + SAP Java Buildpack BOMs -->
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk</groupId>
    	<artifactId>sdk-sjb-bom</artifactId>
    	<version>${cloudsdk.version}</version>
    	<type>pom</type>
    	<scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Work around error in Buildpack BOM -->
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>org.codehaus.woodstox</groupId>
    	<artifactId>stax2-api</artifactId>
    	<scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Set Spring Boot Tomcat dependencies to provided -->
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
    	<scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Any further dependency management you might use
        e.g. org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-dependencies -->
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

:::caution Ordering of dependencies
Please note that the ordering of entries under the `<dependencyManagement>` matters.
To ensure the correct scopes are set make sure the order is implemented as shown above.
In particular the `sdk-sjb-bom` should be the first entry if possible.
:::

- If you are already using the `sdk-bom` simply replace it with the `sdk-sjb-bom`
- The versions for `stax2-api` and `spring-boot-starter-tomcat` are not relevant, only the scopes matter

:::tip Further Guidance
You can find more guidance on how to manage dependencies around the SAP Java Buildpack in our [dedicated guide here](./manage-dependencies).

### Let Application Class Inherit from `SpringBootServletInitializer`

Make your application class a subclass of the class `SpringBootServletInitializer`.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application extends SpringBootServletInitializer {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}

```

### Change the Deployment Configuration

Go to your deployment descriptor, for instance to your mta.yaml, and locate the module that contains your application under `modules`.
For that particular module, perform the following changes:

- Change the `type` from `java` to `java.tomcat`.
- Change the `build-result` so that the file extension is `war`.
- If not present, add the property `USE_JCO` with the value `true` under `properties`.
- If not present, add `buildpack: sap_java_buildpack` under `parameters`.

In the following example we have commented the old values for your reference:

```yaml showLineNumbers {4,9,15,17} title:"mta.yaml"
modules:
  - name: example-project-srv
    #type: java
    type: java.tomcat
    path: srv
    properties:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud
      # make sure that the property USE_JCO is present
      USE_JCO: true
    build-parameters:
      builder: custom
      commands:
        - mvn clean package
      # set the WAR file according to your artifact id
      build-result: target/example-project.war # do not use the -exec.war variant
    parameters:
      buildpack: sap_java_buildpack
    provides:
      - name: srv-api
        properties:
          srv-url: ${default-url}
    requires:
      - name: my-destination
```

## Build and Deploy the Project

The presented changes do not lead to any changes in the build and deployment process.
Hence, you can build and deploy your Java project as usually.

From now on, the JCo classes should be found during runtime.
