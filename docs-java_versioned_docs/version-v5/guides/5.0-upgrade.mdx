## Introduction

Version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK is here and we highly recommend updating to it as soon as possible.
It brings various improvements while keeping the necessary adjustments to an absolute minimum.

There is a good chance that just bumping the version to `5.0.0` is already enough, without the need for any further adjustments.
In particular, updating may be straightforward if you are not using any deprecated API or spawn new threads.

:::note Release Blog Post
For more information also check out our version 5 release blog post
:::

## Before You Update

Before you increase the SAP Cloud SDK version to 5 it can be beneficial to migrate any usage of **deprecated API** first.
Follow the deprecation note of the Javadoc in case you are still using deprecated API from the SAP Cloud SDK.
Most deprecated API is removed With version 5 (exceptions: ).

Begin by upgrading the version to `5.0.0`.
Make sure to apply this for all the places where you declare the SAP Cloud SDK version.
Typically, this is the `sdk-bom` in the dependency management section.

In case you are using any of the code generators (OData, OpenAPI) also increase the version for those.

:::tip Verify the version
You can run `mvn dependency:tree | grep 'com.sap.cloud.sdk'` to verify that all entries are consistently on version 5.

Finally, version 5 discontinued some (legacy) modules and plugins.
Most notably are:
