Version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK is still under active development and hence the migration guide is incomplete.
We will publish the full migration guide when we release v5.

:::

## Steps to migrate `Destination` usages

Version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK comes with a major cleanup of the APIs around the `Destination` concept.
Luckily, this cleanup comes **without a lot of breaking changes** so that existing applications require only a minimum of adjustments.
To make the process of adjusting existing applications as easy as possible, please follow the below steps:

1. Remove any invocation of `Destination#decorate`.
This method was only really used in conjunction with the `DefaultErpHttpDestination`, which has been removed in this major version update.
The functionality has been moved internally, so that decorating existing `Destination` instances is no longer needed.

2. (Optional) Remove any invocations of `Destination#asHttp` or `Destination#asRfc`.
A big part of the `Destination` cleanup was to straighten our public APIs that previously expected specific sub-types of `Destination` or `DestinationProperties` (e.g. `HttpClientAccessor#getHttpClient(HttpDestinationProperties)`).
These APIs now all simply rely on `Destination`, which makes casting via `#asHttp` or `#asRfc` unnecessary.

3. Adjust error handling.
Prior to version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK, `Destination#asHttp` would throw an Exception in case the Destination Service wasn't able to provide a valid `Authorization` header suggestions.
This has been changed so that `asHttp` will no longer throw an Exception.
Instead, calling the `getHeaders` method on an `HttpDestination` will throw an exception if any `Authorization` header suggestion provided by the Destination service contained an error.

This change is **very important** to keep in mind because it influences where applications are expected to catch Exceptions.
For example, code that looks like shown below should be updated:

```java
// ******
// BEFORE
// ******

Destination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");
HttpDestination httpDestination;
try {
    httpDestination = destination.asHttp();
} catch (DestinationAccessException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Destination service wasn't able to provide a valid HTTP destination.", e);
}

try {
    new MyODataService().getAllEntities().executeRequest(httpDestination);
} catch (ODataException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to retrieve odata entities.", e);
}

// ******
// AFTER
// ******

Destination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");

try {
    new MyODataService().getAllEntities().executeRequest(destination);
} catch (DestinationAccessException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Destination service wasn't able to provide a valid HTTP destination.", e);
} catch (ODataException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to retrieve odata entities.", e);
}
```

4. Replace any mentions of `Destination` / `DestinationProperties` implementations other than `DefaultHttpDestination` and `DefaultRfcDestination`.
Version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK removes all other implementations of `Destination` and `DestinationProperties` to unify the APIs and implementations.
As a consequence, classes such as `ScpCfHttpDestination`, `ErpHttpDestination`, and `WrapperDestination` (see the table further down for all removed classes) have been removed.
Therefore, any code that explicitly mentions those classes needs to be updated to use either just `Destination` / `DestinationProperties` or `DefaultHttpDestination` / `DefaultRfcDestination` instead.

<!-- The following section has been commented out, as it doesn't really fit our migration guide. However, having this as a blog post might be suitable.
## Changes to the `Destination` API

One of the biggest changes in version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK for Java evolves around the `Destination` API.
Our primary goal with the following changes is to improve reusability of the `Destination` APIs across different runtime environments.
As an added benefit, we also made the APIs simpler and easier to understand as we eliminated vast parts of (seemingly) duplicated implementations.

### Unification of `HttpDestination` implementations

Up until version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK, modules were structured around the idea of splitting implementations for different runtime environments.
As a consequence, there were many different implementations of the `HttpDestination` interface, such as `DefaultHttpDestination`, `ScpCfHttpDestination`, and `ScpNeoHttpDestination`.
This structure was not optimal as those classes were mostly identical but still behaved slighlty differently in some cases.

In version 5, these differences were eliminated by removing all implementations but the `DefaultHttpDestination`, which is now the one and only implementation of the `HttpDestination` that is shipped within the SAP Cloud SDK.
One part of the removal of existing classes was to consolidate the slight differences in behavior of the previous implementations.
Therefore, consumers shouldn't notice any differences in behavior when using the `DefaultHttpDestination` compared to the previous implementations, regardless on where their application is running.

### Simplification of APIs that expect `Destination` instances

In the past, many of the SAP Cloud SDK's APIs were tailored towards a specific type of `Destination`.
The `HttpClientAccessor`, for example, required an instance of `HttpDestinationProperties` to be passed in order to create an `HttpClient` instance.
This was not optimal as it required consumers to explicitly cast `Destination` instances they retrieved from the `DestinationAccessor` by using the `asHttp` method.
In version 5, we changed our public APIs that previously relied on specific sub-types of `Destination` (or `DestinationProperties`) to use the `Destination` interface directly.
That way, customers no longer need to worry about casting `Destination` instances to a specific sub-type - this will be done automatically within the SAP Cloud SDK.

The `asHttp` (as well as the `asRfc`) methods are still available on the `Destination` interface, but they are no longer mandatory to be called from the application's side.

### Removed API and changed error behavior

Version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK removes the `decorate(...)` method from the `Destination` interface.
This method was previously needed to cover SAP specific On-Premise features.
These features, however, are now integrated into the `DefaultHttpDestination` implementation so that the `decorate(...)` method is no longer needed.

Furthermore, we slightly updated the behavior of `asHttp`:
This method **no longer** throws an Exceptions in case the Destination Service wasn't able to provide a valid `Authorization` header.
Instead, an Exception will be thrown when the `getHeaders` method is used, for example, during the actual request execution.
This is an improvement especially for use cases where the application wants to use the provided convenience getters for HTTP specific properties without actually trying to establish a connection to the target system.

Additionally, `asHttp` and `asRfc` will no longer always return a new instance of `HttpDestination` or `RfcDestination` if the current object is already an instance of `HttpDestination` or `RfcDestination` respectively.

## Introduction

Version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK is here and we highly recommend updating to it as soon as possible.
It brings various improvements while keeping the necessary adjustments to an absolute minimum.

There is a good chance that just bumping the version to `5.0.0` is already enough, without the need for any further adjustments.
In particular, updating may be straightforward if you are not using any deprecated API.

:::note Release Blog Post
For more information also check out our version 5 release blog post
:::

## Before You Update

Before you increase the SAP Cloud SDK version to 5 it can be beneficial to migrate any usage of **deprecated API** first.
Follow the deprecation note of the Javadoc in case you are still using deprecated API from the SAP Cloud SDK.
Most deprecated API is removed With version 5.

## Update Your POM.XML

 -->
<!-- vale on -->
<!--


Begin by upgrading the version to `5.0.0`.
Make sure to apply this for all the places where you declare the SAP Cloud SDK version.
Typically, this is the `sdk-bom` in the dependency management section.

In case you are using any of the code generators (OData, OpenAPI) also increase the version for those.

:::tip Verify the version
You can run `mvn dependency:tree | grep 'com.sap.cloud.sdk'` to verify that all entries are consistently on version 5.
:::

Finally, version 5 discontinued some (legacy) modules and plugins.
Most notably are:

- All Neo related modules
- The SAP Java Buildpack BOM: [replacement Tomcat/TomEE BOMs](dependencies#the-sap-cloud-sdk-bill-of-material)

Remove them if they are present in your pom files.

## Pregenerated Clients

OData and OpenAPI pregenerated clients have been removed, the replacement is to generate clients with the
[OData](../features/odata/generator.mdx) or the [OpenAPI](../features/rest/generate-rest-client.mdx) code generator.
Specifications are available at [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/).
