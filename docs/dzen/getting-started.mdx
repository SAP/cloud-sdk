## What You'll Need?

> A great attitude and a bit of inspiration

### Follow These Steps

- [x] **Be The Best You**
- [ ] Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [ ] Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [ ] Clone [Documentation repository](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/).
- [ ] Open it with you favorite Markdown editor
- [ ] Proceed to the next step

:::tip Use Online GitHub editor if you can't clone things locally

:::

## Running Documentation Locally

Install `Node.js` and `npm` if necessary.
You can use the latest LTS release.

```bash
$ node -v
v12.16.1
$ npm -v
6.14.4
```

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SAP/cloud-sdk.git
cd cloud-sdk
git checkout documentation
```

Run documentation locally.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You should see the following output in your console and documentation should automatically open in your browser.

```bash
> sap-cloud-sdk-documentation@0.1.0 start /home/USERNAME/dev/documentation
> docusaurus start

Starting the development server...

✔ Client
  Compiled successfully in 3.13s

ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:3000/
ℹ ｢wds｣: webpack output is served from /cloud-sdk/
ℹ ｢wds｣: Content not from webpack is served from /home/USERNAME/dev/documentation
ℹ ｢wds｣: 404s will fallback to /index.html

```

A browser tab with the starting page of the documentation portal should open automatically.
Try navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) as a fallback option.

## Documenting

:::info Most of the people using the word `creative` forget about the `create` side of it.
Creativity is the ability to generate innovative ideas and manifest them from thought into reality.
The process involves original thinking and then producing.

**Creative** without producing is just **Imaginative**
:::

:::tip Rule of thumb:

- Less than 5 minutes? - **just do it, no need for a backlog item**
- 15 minutes - 2 hours - **depending on your and your team's preferences add it to the backlog or to you personal to-do list**
- \> 2 hours - **Add an item to the backlog and track it together with the team**

:::

### Getting Hands Dirty

Create a branch for the thing you document.

```bash
git checkout -b java-client-generator-how-to
```

1. All the documentation resides in the `docs` folder.
2. Let's start with creating a file containing our _How To_.
   In my case it will be `java/how-to/generate-client.md`.
3. Use content from this internal [generator how-to](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/MA/sdk/edit/develop/docs/how-to/use-odata-v4.mdx).
4. Add the meta-header and update the fields.

```markdown

title: Generate OData Client
hide_title: false
hide_table_of_contents: false

keywords:

  - cloud sdk
  - sap cloud sdk
---
```

5. Try it locally to enable preview

- [ ] Open `sidebar.js` from project root
- [ ] Find this code snippet in `Java` section

```javascript
        type: 'category',
        label: 'How To',
        items: [...]
```

- [ ] Add your file to the `How To` category

```javascript
        type: 'category',
        label: 'How To',
        items: [
          'java/how-to/generate-odata-client-with-cloud-sdk-for-java-how-to',
          'java/how-to/sap-cloud-sdk-linux-how-to',
          'java/how-to/cf-cli',
		  '...'
		  ]
```

- [ ] Start your project by running `npm start`, it should recompile automatically on every change afterward
- [ ] Make sure you can access your article via [localhost](http://localhost:3000/cloud-sdk/docs/java/how-to/generate-odata-client-with-cloud-sdk-for-java-how-to)

6. Showcase your knowledge, creativity, and markdown skills by delivering concise but useful documentation.
   Please, check [this material on good writing practices](how-to-write-documentation).
7. Be proud of yourself!

### Go Live!

Time to show your work to the world!

- [ ] Make sure your documentation builds

```bash
npm run build
```

- [ ] Please, `commit` you work and create a `pull-request`.

<img alt="pull-request" src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/pull-request.png')} />

#### Review

Ask someone to review your work.
Please, make sure you followed [these best practices](how-to-write-documentation) and the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Publish

After your pull request is merged, the pipeline will automatically publish a new version of the documentation.
You can check [GitHub actions](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Release+Cloud+SDK+documentation%22) for Documentation or navigate to the live documentation portal and check if your changes are applied.

I recommend reloading the page without cache.

## Conventions

- Static content resides in the `static` folder.
- Linking to files and images from Markdown starts from the folder where your file is located.
  In this case, if I want to link anything in the `docs` folder I'll have to go with [my-link](/docs/java/getting-started).
  You can reach up until the root `docs` folder level with this approach.
- To make a dynamic link to the `static` folder content you'll need to use a snippet similar to the one below:

<!-- vale off -->

```js
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
<img alt="pull-request" src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/pull-request.png')} />;
```

<!-- vale on -->

- Of course, you can link with `your-link/your-path#your-heading`,
  check the right-side menu for the links like [sending you to the top](http://localhost:3000/cloud-sdk/docs/dzen/getting-started#what-youll-need).

## Linters

We use linters to catch the most frequent writing issues.
Please, use them at all times.
The best way to do it, is by adding an extension to your favorite editor.

### Vale

We use a linter for [Vale](https://docs.errata.ai/) a linter for prose.
It's a powerful tool to keep our writing consistent.
Please, check the [documentation](https://docs.errata.ai/) for more details.

In the situation where linting for grammar and writing style doesn't make sense use the following configuration tags to disable linting for that fragment.

```
<!-- vale off -->

This is some text

more text here...

<!-- vale on -->

<!-- vale Style.Rule = NO -->

This is some text

<!-- vale Style.Rule = YES -->
```

### Prettier

Our [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) configuration supports Markdown and will help you keep the style consistent.
Please, run `npm run prettier` before you commit your code.
