## What You'll Need?

> A great attitude and a bit of inspiration

### Follow These Steps

- [x] **Be The Best You**
- [ ] Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [ ] Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [ ] Clone [Documentation repository](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/).
- [ ] Open it with you favorite Markdown editor
- [ ] Proceed to the next step

:::tip Use Online GitHub editor if you can't clone things locally

:::

## Running Documentation Locally

Install `Node.js` and `npm` if necessary.
You can use the latest LTS release.

```bash
$ node -v
v12.16.1
$ npm -v
6.14.4
```

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SAP/cloud-sdk.git
cd cloud-sdk
git checkout documentation
```

Run documentation locally.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

You should see the following output in your console and documentation should automatically open in your browser.

```bash
> sap-cloud-sdk-documentation@0.1.0 start /home/USERNAME/dev/documentation
> docusaurus start

Starting the development server...

✔ Client
  Compiled successfully in 3.13s

ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:3000/
ℹ ｢wds｣: webpack output is served from /cloud-sdk/
ℹ ｢wds｣: Content not from webpack is served from /home/USERNAME/dev/documentation
ℹ ｢wds｣: 404s will fallback to /index.html

```

A browser tab with the starting page of the documentation portal should open automatically.
Try navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) as a fallback option.

## Documenting

:::info Most of the people using the word `creative` forget about the `create` side of it.
Creativity is the ability to generate innovative ideas and manifest them from thought into reality.
The process involves original thinking and then producing.

**Creative** without producing is just **Imaginative**
:::

:::tip Rule of thumb:

- Less than 5 minutes? - **just do it, no need for a backlog item**
- 15 minutes - 2 hours - **depending on your and your team's preferences add it to the backlog or to you personal to-do list**
- \> 2 hours - **Add an item to the backlog and track it together with the team**

:::

### Getting Hands Dirty

Create a branch for the thing you document.

```bash
git checkout -b java-client-generator-how-to
```

1. All the documentation resides in the `docs` folder.
2. Let's start with creating a file containing our _How To_.
   In my case it will be `java/how-to/generate-client.md`.
3. Use content from this internal [generator how-to](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/MA/sdk/edit/develop/docs/how-to/use-odata-v4.mdx).
4. Add the meta-header and update the fields.

```markdown

```

5. Try it locally to enable preview

- [ ] Open `sidebar.js` from project root
- [ ] Find this code snippet in `Java` section

```javascript
        type: 'category',
        label: 'How To',
        items: [...]
```

- [ ] Add your file to the `How To` category

```javascript
        type: 'category',
        label: 'How To',
        items: [
          'java/how-to/generate-odata-client-with-cloud-sdk-for-java-how-to',
          'java/how-to/sap-cloud-sdk-linux-how-to',
          'java/how-to/cf-cli',
		  '...'
		  ]
```

- [ ] Start your project by running `npm start`, it should recompile automatically on every change afterward
- [ ] Make sure you can access your article via [localhost](http://localhost:3000/cloud-sdk/docs/java/how-to/generate-odata-client-with-cloud-sdk-for-java-how-to)

6. Showcase your knowledge, creativity, and markdown skills by delivering concise but useful documentation.
   Please, check [this material on good writing practices](how-to-write-documentation).
7. Be proud of yourself!

### Go Live!

Time to show your work to the world!

- [ ] Make sure your documentation builds

```bash
npm run build
```

- [ ] Please, `commit` you work and create a `pull-request`.

<img alt="pull-request" src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/pull-request.png')} />

#### Review

Ask someone to review your work.
Please, make sure you followed [these best practices](how-to-write-documentation) and the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Publish

After your pull request is merged, the pipeline will automatically publish a new version of the documentation.
You can check [GitHub actions](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Release+Cloud+SDK+documentation%22) for Documentation or navigate to the live documentation portal and check if your changes are applied.

:::tip Clear Cache
I recommend reloading the page without cache.

## Conventions

- Static content resides in the `static` folder.
- Linking to files and images from Markdown starts from the folder where your file is located.
  In this case, if I want to link anything in the `docs` folder I'll have to go with [my-link](../java/getting-started).
  You can reach up until the root `docs` folder level with this approach.
- To make a dynamic link to the `static` folder content you'll need to use a snippet similar to the one below:

<!-- vale off -->

```js
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
<img alt="pull-request" src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/pull-request.png')} />;
```

<!-- vale on -->

- Of course, you can link with `your-link/your-path#your-heading`,
  check the right-side menu for the links like [sending you to the top](http://localhost:3000/cloud-sdk/docs/dzen/getting-started#what-youll-need).
