## SAP Cloud SDK Documentation Guidelines

> If you can write code, you can write docs.

## Markdown Hints

- Start your page with `H2` because `H1` is for `title` specified in the `meta-header`
- If you need `Tabs` or other react components, hoist them to the top of the page after the `meta-header`
- Consider creating snippets for your editor for the most used components like: `meta-header`, `admonitions`, `tabs`, etc
- Run docs locally to ensure your page looks nice.
  Some design ideas in your head may look different with additional context.

## Take Ownership

- If you see a typo, fix it and make a pull request
- If updating your or someone else's article takes less than 10-15 minutes - just do it.
- If something can't be fixed by you - notify the author or the respective team.

## General Notes on Writing

People who do not write frequently often struggle with putting words on paper.
It's normal.
A mental-ease will come with practice.

### Basic Recommendations About Writing

#### Write as You Speak

Imagine you're explaining what the SAP Cloud SDK does to a friend with enough tech background but without SAP context.

Many people think writing is different from speaking.
Not that much.
Speaking is the most natural way to transfer information for humans.
Write as if you're chatting to someone, answering questions, or asking questions to yourself.
Then edit where there's a lack of structure.

> Such texts are much easier to read and comprehend than those written in cumbersome and complicated ways.

#### Use Simple Words

Don't try to out-smart yourself.
Use the most common and simple words to get your point across.
Check what others use, if you are not sure.
Be consistent.
Google a couple of options if in doubt.
Be careful with acronyms, they may be unknown.

#### More Active Case

Passive voice:

> Resilience is increased when using circuit breakers.

Active voice:

> Circuit breakers increase resilience.

Active voice helps the reader identify actor, action, and cause.
You should prefer the active voice when writing documentation.
Passive voice can be acceptable when used sparingly.

#### Use Short Sentences

Make sentences as long as needed, but as short as possible.
If you have a second subordinate clause, you should think about splitting the sentence.

#### Use Examples

Examples are more helpful than abstract terms following each other.
A good example helps connect dots between concepts and builds stronger understanding.

#### Build Upon the Context

Similar to defining a function for a code, reusing context allows us to reuse already introduced concepts.
It makes the explanation more concise, easy to read, and allows for scalable writing.
Make sure there's just enough context introduced and provide links or reminders where it might be lacking.

#### Use Spelling and Grammar Checking

Linting, code style, static analysis, and typos - writing is no different from coding here.
I found 16 issues in this document after checking it with the free version of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).

#### "Steal" Relentlessly

<!-- vale SAP.Products = NO -->

Think about if someone has already documented what you now want to document.
Use it as an example!
Take parts of it if relevant.
Be mindful and check copyrights if copying too much.
Bookmark a couple of favorite documentation web-sites and visit them for inspiration.
Think of Google Cloud SDK, GraphQL, React, etc.

<!-- vale SAP.Products = YES -->

#### Ask for Review

Open a pull request and let us help you.

#### Avoid Variant Reading

Make sure you'll be understood one way and one way only.
For example, try to understand and make a single interpretation for [odata.type meta field](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.01/odata-json-format-v4.01.html#sec_ControlInformationtypeodatatype).
Don't spend too much time on it.

#### Minimum Viable Product

Don't be hard on yourself.
Make something imperfect and improve with every iteration.
Any documentation is better than no documentation.
Use feedback to iterate.
Involve collaborators.
None of us are professional writers.

#### Inverted Pyramid Style

Think a bit before getting to the text editor.
Or start with an outline.
Same as with structuring your class methods and variables it makes eventual writing much simpler and often faster.
Here's a method from the journalism world called [inverted pyramid](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)>).
It might be useful for documentation, in the same way, it's useful for news.
