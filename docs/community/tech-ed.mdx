## TechEd 2020

### Introduction

In 2020, we ran two sessions of a workshop about extending SAP S/4HANA in a cloud-native way.
No worries if you have missed it!

Check the introduction deck to understand why side-by-side extensibility matters and how to do it in a healthy way.
Then put your knowledge into practice by following our [exercise](#exercise) hosted on GitHub.

### Exercise

The exercise for this workshop is hosted in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-DT261).
You can run all the code locally or deploy it to the SAP Business Technology Platform and test it there.
For that, we recommend creating a free trial account and activating Business Application Studio.
You'll find detailed instructions on how to do it in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/blob/main/README.md) of the repository.
