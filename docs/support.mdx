## Public Support Channels

If your question or support incident does not contain internal or sensitive information, use the public support channels like GitHub and Stack Overflow.

### GitHub

Please create an issue in one of the public repositories:

- **Java**: ask a question, give feedback or create an issue [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/issues/new/choose).
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ask a question, give feedback or create an issue [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new/choose).
- **Documentation**: request documentation or suggest fixes [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/issues/new/choose).

### Stack Overflow

Use the `sap-cloud-sdk` tag on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sap-cloud-sdk) to search for solved issues or create yours.

## For Registered SAP Customers - Use SAP One Support Launchpad

As a registered SAP customer, you can use the [SAP One Support Launchpad](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/) to report issues.
We recommend using this channel when you need to share **internal or sensitive** information.
In other cases, [public support channels](#public-support-channels) are preferred.

Use **XX-S4C-SDK** component to get the incident routed directly to the SAP Cloud SDK team.
