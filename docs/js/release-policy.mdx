## Minor and Major Release Policy

### Timelines

- We release a new **minor version** every 2 weeks, assuming new functionality or fixes are available.
- We release a new **major version** every 6 to 12 months.
- A few months before the major release, we announce the expected changes and planned release date.

### Upgrading to a New Minor Version

- Upgrade to a new **minor release version** should not involve any effort because we do not introduce breaking changes.

:::info TypeScript version bumps

We regularly upgrade TypeScript to the latest stable version.
In rare cases this can lead to compilation errors for projects using TypeScript.
The solution is usually upgrading TypeScript to the latest stable version.

:::

### Upgrading to a New Major Version

- We provide a step-by-step upgrade guide for each major version.
- Following the upgrade steps should take less than a day of development effort regardless of the project size.

### Fixes, Maintenance, Documentation

- We maintain only the **latest major release** of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.
- The documentation is always up to date with the **latest major release**.

### Support and feedback

We are happy to hear from you and usually respond within one day.
