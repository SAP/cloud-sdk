## Minor and Major Release Policy

- We release a new minor version every 2 weeks, assuming new functionality or fixes are available.

- We release a new major version every 6 to 12 months.
  A few months before the release, we announce the expected changes and planned timeline.

- We provide a step-by-step migration guide for each major version.
  Following the migration steps should take less than a day of development effort regardless of the project size.

- We provide fixes and new features only for the most current version of the SAP Cloud SDK.
