## Minor and Major Release Policy

### Timelines

- We release a new **minor version** every 2 weeks, assuming new functionality or fixes are available.
- We release a new **major version** every 6 to 12 months.
  A few months before the release, we announce the expected changes and planned timeline.

### Upgrading to a New Major Version

- We provide a step-by-step migration guide for each major version.
  Following the migration steps should take less than a day of development effort regardless of the project size.

### Fixes, Maintenance, Documentation

- We provide fixes and new features only for the most current version of the SAP Cloud SDK.
- The documentation is always up to date with the latest major release

### Support and feedback

We are happy to hear from you and usually respond within 1 day.
