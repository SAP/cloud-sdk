In this tutorial, you'll do the following:

- Install `Node.js` and `npm`.
- Install Nest CLI.
- Install `cf` CLI, the command line interface for interacting with Cloud Foundry.

## Node.js and npm

You should have `Node.js` and `npm` installed.
To see whether you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands on the command line:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

If one of those commands fails because the command was not found you will have to install Node.js.
It is recommend to use at least Node.js version 11.0.0 and npm version 6.0.0.
The latest LTS version (10.15.3 as of today), will also work.
If you have Node.js and npm installed at a current version, skip ahead to the next step.

### Install Node.js and npm

We recommend to install Node.js using a package manager or a node version manager suitable for your platform.
You are free to use an installer, though npm will automatically be installed together with Node.js.
npm can be updated by running the following command from your command line:

```shell
npm install -g npm
```

## Install Nest CLI

You need to have the Nest CLI installed to create a new project.
You can install it globally by executing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```


## Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface

You will need the Cloud Foundry command line interface (`cf` CLI) to later deploy your application to SAP Business Technology Platform.
To see whether it is already installed, you can run the following on your command line:

```shell
cf -v
```

If the command fails, you will need to install it.

You can find installation instructions for all common platforms in the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
Again, it is recommend to use a package manager for that.
If you are using `chocolatey` on Windows, please find the instructions [here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/cloudfoundry-cli).

## Editor / IDE

Feel free to choose your favorite `IDE`.
Internally, we are using `Visual Studio Code` for its excellent JavaScript and TypeScript support.
However, this tutorial does not rely on any specific editor.
