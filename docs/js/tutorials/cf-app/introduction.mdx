## About This Tutorial

This tutorial is divided into multiple sections:

- [Setup for the Tutorial](./set-up-dev-enviroment-tutorial) tells you about tools you need to getting started.
- [Create a new Project](./create-a-new-project-tutorial) will teach you about setting up your application and it's project structure.
- [Execute an OData Request](./create-your-first-application-tutorial) will give you a deeper insight into using a pregenerated client in SAP Cloud SDK development.
- [Deploy Application to Cloud Foundry](./deploy-application-to-cloud-foundry-tutorial) informs you about managing destinations in Cloud Foundry in SAP BTP.

## About the Application

In this tutorial, you will build your own application from scratch, using the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript and NestJS.
[NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) is a progressive `Node.js` framework for building scalable and reliant server-side applications.

The application will use the [Business Partner VDM](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/cloud-sdk/JavaScript) and connect to an `SAP S/4HANA Cloud` system.
It will fetch a list of Business Partners and provide the result to a service endpoint that users can consume.
You will leverage several of the SAP Cloud SDK features such as [request builders](../../features/odata/use-odata-v2-type-safe-client-for-javascript-typescript#getall-request-builder), [entity builders](../../features/odata/use-odata-v2-type-safe-client-for-javascript-typescript#build-an-entity-from-scratch), etc to make requests against the target SAP S/4HANA system.
You will also learn about features that are abstracted such as connectivity, authentication, etc. 
`
## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge about the following:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming concepts like functions, arrays, etc
- [Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html) - spaces, cf CLI
- [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/daca64dacc6148fcb5c70ed86082ef91.html) concepts such as destinations, UAA services

## Learning Outcomes

After reading the tutorial, you will learn how to do the following tasks:

- Consume a pre-generated client in your application.
- Use the SAP Cloud SDK to perform basic CRUD operations against a SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
- Create and configure a destination and use it in your application
- Deploy your application to a Cloud Foundry space.
