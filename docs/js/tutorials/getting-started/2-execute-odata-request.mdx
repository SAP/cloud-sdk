In this part of the tutorial, you will do the following:

- Set up a mock server (optional).
- Extend your starter NestJS application by adding a custom route.
- Call the business partner service of SAP S/4HANA Cloud using the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.
- Manage destinations centrally during development (optional).

## Set Up a Mock Server (Optional)

:::note
If you have access to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system with a technical user, you can skip this part.
:::

There are multiple ways to get an OData service, you can either setup your own mock server or you can use the sandbox API.

To make a call to an OData service, there needs to be a service to call.
You can setup a local mock server by following the instructions [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-s4-sdk-book/pages/mock-odata.html).
This server hosts an OData v2 mock service that mimics the business partner API.
It does not support all the features of the actual OData services, but it suffices to try it out locally.

Once it is up and running you should see the list of services at `http://localhost:3000/`.

Alternatively, many APIs can also be tested using the sandbox of the SAP API Business Hub.
To use the sandbox, you need an _API key_.
Go to https://api.sap.com and click _Login_ in the top right corner.
If you do not have an account, you will need to register first.
When you are logged in, click on _Hi name_ in the top right corner and then click on _Settings_ in the dropdown menu that just opened.
On the settings page, click _Show API Key_.

## Add a Custom Route

Initially, the app only contains the `hello-world` route.
We will add another route for `business-parters` that will list all available business partners.

First, create a new file `business-partner.controller.ts` in the `src/` directory and add an implementation for this route, like so:

```ts
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller()
export class BusinessPartnerController {
  @Get('business-partners')
  getBusinessPartners() {
    return 'We will implement this in a minute.';
  }
}
```

The `@Controller()` decorator marks our class as controller (i.e. a thing that handles requests), and the `@Get('business-partners')` decorator marks the `getBusinessPartners` method as handler for GET requests on the path `/business-partners`.
The `@Controller()` decorator allows [providing more configuration](https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers), but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

In order for the controller to work, we also need to register it in our application.
Open `app.module.ts`, import the controller class you just created and add it to the `controllers` declaration.
Your file should look like this:

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { BusinessPartnerController } from './business-partner.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController, BusinessPartnerController],
  providers: [AppService]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

If you've started your application with the following command in the previous tutorial, it should detect the change and restart automatically.

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

If you've terminated your application, you can restart it by running the start command again.
Now, calling `http://localhost:8080/business-partners` should return our placeholder string.

## Import Service Entities

To use the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript to make a call to an OData service, add the client library for this service to your dependencies.
For this tutorial, we are using the client library for the business partner service.
Install it with the following command:

```shell
npm install @sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service@latest
```

Import the service function and entity exported by the client library.
Add the following line to the top of the `business-partner.controller.ts`.

```ts
import {
  businessPartnerService,
  BusinessPartner
} from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';
```

:::note
The `SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript` offers packages for each OData service exposed by SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
You can find a list of these services in the SAP API Business Hub.
:::

## Execute an OData Request

In `business-partner.controller.ts` create a function `getAllBusinessPartners`.
Get the API for the entity you want to make a call to in your application.
Unpack the API object you need from the service function using [JavaScript Object Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).
In this tutorial, we are using the `businessPartnerEntityApi` of the business partner service.

Depending on your API Server, the destination configuration can vary:

<Tabs groupId="scenario" defaultValue="mock-server" values={[
{ label: 'Mock Server', value: 'mock-server'},{ label: 'SAP S/4HANA Cloud System', value: 's4hana-cloud'},{ label: 'SAP API Business Hub Sandbox', value: 'api-hub-sandbox'}]}>

<TabItem value="mock-server">

```ts
function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000'
  });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="s4hana-cloud">

```ts
function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    url: '<URI of your SAP S/4HANA Cloud System>',
    username: '<USERNAME>',
    password: '<PASSWORD>'
  });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api-hub-sandbox">

```ts
function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return businessPartnerApi
    .requestBuilder()
    .getAll()
    .withCustomHeaders({ APIKey: '<YOUR-API-KEY>' })
    .execute({
      url: 'https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud'
    });
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

As network requests are asynchronous by nature, the return value of this function is a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to a list of business partners `(Promise<BusinessPartner[]>)`.

Let's add the execution of this request to `getBusinessPartners` method:

```ts
import { Controller, Get, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Get('business-partners')
getBusinessPartners() {
  return getAllBusinessPartners()
    .catch(error => {
      throw new HttpException(`Failed to get business partners - ${error.message}`, 500);
    });
}

```

`Nest.js` will handle the `Promise` we return automatically.
We add a `.catch` handler to specify how errors are handled (otherwise it would only show `internal server error` when something goes wrong).
Reload the `http://localhost:8080/business-partners` URL to retrieve a list of business partners.

Congratulations, you just made your first call with the SAP Cloud SDK!

## Manage Destinations Centrally (Optional)

To avoid repeating your destination configuration for every request execution, you can set a destinations environment variable to manage your destinations.
In `Node.js` application, it is common to use a `.env` file to maintain such environment variables for a given project.
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and define the destinations environment variable as follows:

```ts
destinations = [
  {
    name: '<DESTINATIONNAME>',
    url: '<URL to your system>',
    username: '<USERNAME>',
    password: '<PASSWORD>'
  }
];
```

:::caution
Please do not use this approach in production and also include the .env file in your .gitignore list, so that it is not checked in.
:::

This is what it would look like for the mock server:

```ts
destinations = [{ name: 'MockServer', url: 'http://localhost:3000' }];
```

Now that we have defined our destinations, we need to make sure that they are available in our process.
For this we use the `config` package provided by `nest.js`. You can install it with the following command:

```shell
npm install @nestjs/config
```

To load the environment variables defined in the `.env` file, we need to add the `ConfigModule` provided by the `config` package to the application's `@Module` definition.
Open `app.module.ts` and update it with the following code:

```ts
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
  controllers: [AppController, BusinessPartnerController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
```

`ConfigModule` is imported from the `config` package and in we add it to the module's `imports`.
If no arguments are passed to the `forRoot()` method, the `.env` file has to be located in the project root.
For details on the possible configuration see the [nest documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration).
To reference a destination in the request execution, replace the URL with a destinationName - `MockServer` in our example:

```ts
function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  return BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().getAll().execute({
    destinationName: 'MockServer'
  });
}
```

:::note
Every environment variable in the `.env` file has to be defined on one line.
You can add more destinations to the array.
:::

## Final Code Review

Here are the code files discussed on this page, if you are using the mock server:

<Tabs groupId="code-files" defaultValue="bupa-controller" values={[{ label: 'src/business-partner.controller.ts', value: 'bupa-controller'}, { label: 'src/app.module.ts', value: 'app-module'}]}>
<TabItem value="bupa-controller">

```ts
import { Controller, Get, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { businessPartnerService, BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

@Controller()
export class BusinessPartnerController {
  @Get('business-partners')
  getBusinessPartners() {
    return getAllBusinessPartners()
      .catch(error => {
        throw new HttpException(`Failed to get business partners - ${error.message}`, 500);
      });
  }

function getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
  const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
  return businessPartnerApi
    .requestBuilder()
    .getAll()
    .execute({
      destinationName: 'MockServer'
    });
  }
}
```
