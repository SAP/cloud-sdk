## About This Tutorial

This tutorial is divided into multiple sections:

- [Setup](./set-up-dev-enviroment) tells you about tools you need, setting up a NestJS application, and its project structure.
- [Execute an OData Request](./execute-an-odata-request) will give you a deeper insight into using a pregenerated client to execute requests against an OData service.
- [Deploy Application to Cloud Foundry](./deploy-app-to-cf) informs you about managing destinations in Cloud Foundry in SAP BTP.

## About the Application

In this tutorial, you will build your own application from scratch, using the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript and NestJS.
[NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) is a framework for building server-side Node.js applications.

The application will use the [business partner client library](https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/cloud-sdk/JavaScript) and connect to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
It will fetch a list of business partners and provide the result to a service endpoint that users can consume.
You will leverage several of the SAP Cloud SDK features such as [request builders](../../features/odata/use-odata-v2-type-safe-client-for-javascript-typescript#getall-request-builder) to make requests against the target SAP S/4HANA system.
You will also learn about features that are abstracted such as connectivity, authentication, etc.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge about the following:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming concepts like functions, arrays, etc.
- [Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html) - spaces, cf CLI.
- [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/daca64dacc6148fcb5c70ed86082ef91.html) concepts such as destinations, UAA services.

For deploying your application to Cloud Foundry in SAP Business Technology Platform, you will need an account.
You can get a trial account [here](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html) or use an existing account, if you already have one.

You also need to have access to an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system with a technical user.
If no SAP S/4HANA Cloud system is available, you can set up a mock server or use a sandbox API as described [here](./execute-an-odata-request#set-up-a-mock-server-optional).

## Learning Outcomes

After reading the tutorial, you will learn how to do the following tasks:

- Consume a pre-generated client in your application.
- Use the SAP Cloud SDK to perform basic GET requests against a SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
- Create and configure a destination and use it in your application.
- Deploy your application to a Cloud Foundry space.
