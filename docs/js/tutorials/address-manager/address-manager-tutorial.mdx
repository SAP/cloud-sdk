## Overview

In the S/4HANA data model, Addresses are related to the business partner entity.
Each business partner can have multiple addresses assigned.
The application will provide a REST Api to manage addresses of business partners.

The tutorial is based on the initial `NestJs` application explained in this tutorial.XXX

## Get All Business Partners

### Install the Typed Client

The first service endpoint will retrieve all business partners.
Install the typed client for the business partner OData endpoint:

```shell
npm install @sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service@^2.0.0
```

### Create Service

A `NestJS` application is based on three main entities: `Service`, `Controller` and `Module`.

In the scaffold a set of these entities has already been created: `app.service.ts`, `app.controller.ts` and `app.module.ts`. We will create a new set in order to query business partners from a S/4HANA Cloud system. For details on the concepts have a look at the [Nest tutorials](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps). Start with a `business-partner.service.ts` file, which will contain the implementation of the query:

We will create a new set in order to query business partners from a S/4HANA Cloud system.
For details on the concepts have a look at the [Nest tutorials](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps).
Start with a `business-partner.service.ts` file, which will contain the implementation of the query:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class BusinessPartnerService {
  public dummyText = 'Not yet implemented.';

  getAllBusinessPartners(): string {
    return this.dummyText;
  }
}
```


Create a `business-partner.controller.ts` which takes care of directing incoming requests to the needed implementation:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BusinessPartnerService } from './business-partner.service';
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

@Controller('business-partners')
export class BusinessPartnerController {
  constructor(private readonly businessPartnerService: BusinessPartnerService) {}

  @Get()
  getAllBusinessPartners(): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
    return this.businessPartnerService.getAllBusinessPartners();
  }
}
```


As a last step we have to register the controller and service. In order to keep the example brief, just add the controller and service to the `app.module.ts` which is the root module of the Nest application:

```JavaScript / TypeScript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { BusinessPartnerController } from './business-partner.controller';
import { BusinessPartnerService } from './business-partner.service';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController,BusinessPartnerController],
  providers: [AppService,BusinessPartnerService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```


### Test Service

Now you can start your application using:
```Shell
npm start
```
When the server is running, you should see a message like: `[NestApplication] Nest application successfully started` and some mappings related to the listed controllers. Open the URL `http://localhost:3000/business-partners` and you should see `Not yet implemented.`
