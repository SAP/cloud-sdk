# Upgrade Strategy for the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript

The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

We release a new minor or patch version every 2 weeks, assuming new functionality or fixes are available.

We release a new major version every 6 to 12 months.
A few months before the release, we announce the expected changes and preliminary timeline.

We provide a step-by-step upgrade guide for each major version.
Following these steps takes less than a day of effort, no matter the project size.

We provide new fixes and features only for the most current version of the SAP Cloud SDK.

The next major release will be SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript version 2, expected for January 2022.

This upgrade strategy only applies to the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript and is not applicable to the SAP Cloud SDK for Java!
