# Upgrade Strategy for the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript

The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript was initially released over 2 years ago in March 2019.
Since then, we have collected ideas that will help speed up development and introduce valuable features, but require breaking changes.
We outline our plans regrading the schedule for major releases, SAP Cloud SDK version 2, and developer support in this document.

:::info

This upgrade strategy only applies to the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript and is not applicable to the SAP Cloud SDK for Java!

:::

## Abstract

- We will release a new major version every 6 to 12 months with version 2 expected January 2022
- We will ensure that upgrading will take minimal effort and provide a step-by-step guide
- We will provide new fixes and features only for the most current version of the SAP Cloud SDK

## What Will Happen?

Our mission is to help you develop cloud-based apps and extensions to SAP solutions.
So far, we always stayed backwards compatible to avoid migration efforts for you.
This has been the right strategy until now, but some past decisions are slowing or preventing progress.
Making these changes will have many benefits for the usability of the SAP Cloud SDK and our development speed.

With this document, we want to share our plans regarding timeline, content and support.
Following our mission, we want to make upgrading as easy as possible.
Please [reach out to us](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/discussions/1518) if you have feedback, suggestions or improvements!

## When Will This Happen?

The preliminary timeline looks as follows:

1. September/October: Start of development
2. November: Publish beta versions and start of feedback cycle
3. December: Publish release candidate
4. January 2022: Release of SAP Cloud SDK 2.0.0

We will continuously publish beta versions and would appreciate feedback on these releases.
This feedback will be included in later beta releases.
Once all features are implemented, a release candidate will be published for end-to-end evaluation.
The final release will happen after the evaluation of the release candidate is completed.

During this time, we may postpone changes that have a workaround or are not time sensitive.
Important and time sensitive issues will, of course, be resolved within our usual response time.

We will continuously release new major versions aiming for a 6 to 12 months cycle.
Between these major releases, we will continue with a biweekly release cycle to deliver non-breaking changes.

## What Will Change in Version 2?

The preliminary list of changes are:

### Replace `Moment.js` With a Flexible Middleware Approach for Deserialization

`Moment.js` used to be somewhat of a standard for JavaScript date handling, but is now in [maintenance mode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment#project-status).
It is also a rather large dependency and not optimized for tree shaking.
We will remove the direct dependency to `Moment.js` and allow you to choose a middleware that suits your project.
We will provide a few popular options including a `Moment.js`-based middleware for the easiest possible migration.
This gives you flexibility while reducing package size dramatically.

### Split Packages and Export Only the Public Interface

The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript exports many functions that are used across our packages, but are not supposed to be part of the public interface.
We will clean up these exports and are expecting a better experience when using IntelliSense or similar autocompletion tools.
As long as you don't use undocumented methods, this change should not need any migration.

### Increase Compilation Target to ECMAScript 2019

We are currently compiling to meet the ECMAScript 5 standard.
This is not needed anymore as `Node.js` fully supports ECMAScript 2019 in both the Maintenance LTS (v12) and Active LTS (v14).
We expect a reduction in package size and a slight performance improvement.
No changes to your projects will be necessary unless it depends on ECMAScript 5 compatibility.

### Remove Deprecated Functionality

We marked outdated functionality as deprecated.
These functions will be removed during the major version increase.
We expect a minor reduction in package size.
If you still use a deprecated function, you should start replacing any occurrence with the proposed alternative as mentioned in the release notes.

## What Will the Upgrade Look Like?

Applying an upgrade is additional effort.
We want to minimize this.
Our team will provide a detailed upgrade guide for each major version release.
The guide will include step-by-step changes to resolve any incompatibilities.
Following these steps should be possible in less than a day, no matter the project size.

:::tip Looking For Feedback

To achieve this, we will need your feedback during beta and release candidate phase.
Please let us know if you want to collaborate with us on finding problems and solutions for the upgrade guide.

:::

## Will Old Major Versions Be Updated?

We decided that we will not provide bug fixes or features for older versions.
The SAP Cloud SDK is an open source project and everyone is welcome to contribute, but we are a small team with limited time.
As more major versions are released, the complexity for maintenance and support increases dramatically.

Our team will provide bug fixes and features only in the newest version.
We recommend you upgrade early to get access to any new fixes and features.
If something is not covered in our upgrade guide or otherwise prevents you from upgrading, we will happily support you to resolve that issue.

## Onward

We are looking forward to the next major release.
This first release has some features and many changes behind the scenes.
It will give us more freedom to provide new features and reduce technical debt to accelerate our development.
We are hoping everything will go smooth, but we are also looking forward to your feedback.
It's the only way we can ensure that the next upgrade will be even better!
