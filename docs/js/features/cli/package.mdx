:::caution CLI is deprecated

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI is deprecated. We'll provide replacement for key value adds of the CLI like project scaffolding, etc.

## Benefits of Using the SAP Cloud SDK CLI in Continuous Delivery

A project initialized with the SAP Cloud SDK CLI provides all the necessary configuration to be used with [Project "Piper"](../../../related-projects/project-piper).
It also provides a cross-platform way to copy deployment files that can help if your team develops on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Set Up a Jenkins Pipeline

Follow the [guide](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/guidedtour/) at Project "Piper" to find all information necessary to set up a new pipeline server.
You may use the SAP Cloud SDK CLI to download the necessary files.

```bash
$ sap-cloud-sdk add-cx-server
```

## Pipeline Steps

The Project "Piper" pipeline contains many stages to ensure enterprise and cloud qualities.
Here is a list of stages which you should know about.
For projects generated with the CLI, all these scripts are automatically maintained.

- **Build**:
  You need to maintain the `ci-build` script in the `package.json`.
- **Test**:
  You need to maintain the `ci-it-backend` and `ci-backend-unit-test` scripts in the `package.json`.
  If you built with `--addFrontendScripts` you also need to maintain `ci-frontend-unit-test` and `ci-e2e`.
- **Package**:
  You may need to maintain the `ci-package` script in the `package.json`.
  By default, this copies the `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `index.js`, and the contents of the `dist` folder.
  You can use [glob patterns](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) to include or exclude other files.
- **Deploy**:
  Configure your deployment in the `.pipeline/config.yml` and the `mainfest.yml`.
