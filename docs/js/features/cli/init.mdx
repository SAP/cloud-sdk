:::caution CLI is deprecated

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI is deprecated.
We'll provide replacement for key value adds of the CLI like project scaffolding, etc.

:::

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI adds necessary dependencies and configurations to use the SAP Cloud SDK and deploy your app to SAP Business Technology Platform with one command.
This is possible for any existing project that uses `npm`.

If you are starting from scratch, the SAP Cloud SDK CLI can also generate a fully-loaded new project to get you started quickly.
This uses the CLI of our recommended backend framework [Nest](https://nestjs.com) and enhances it with the SAP Cloud SDK.

## Add the SAP Cloud SDK to an Existing Project

Do you want to add the SAP Cloud SDK to your existing Node.js application?

Do you want to use the backend and testing frameworks you already know?

If you answered yes to either question, you can use the SAP Cloud SDK CLI to add the SAP Cloud SDK and necessary configuration to your project.
The command-line tool will guide you step-by-step to create the right configuration for your project.

```bash
$ cd my-project

$ sap-cloud-sdk init
Enter project name (for use in manifest.yml) [my-project]:
Enter the command to start your application: npm start

  âœ” Creating files
  âœ” Adding dependencies to package.json
  âœ” Installing dependencies
  âœ” Modifying `.gitignore`
```

### Options

#### Project Directory

You can set the project directory via a flag or as a path parameter.
**The default value is the working directory.**
If the project directory is empty, the CLI will offer to create a new project.

```bash
$ sap-cloud-sdk init PROJECTDIR

$ sap-cloud-sdk init --projectDir=PROJECTDIR
```

#### SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

Add a `cds` configuration and example data to follow the SAP Cloud Application Programming model.
**By default, this configuration is not added.**

This can also be added with a separate command.

```bash
# Initialize the project with the SAP Cloud SDK and set up SAP CAP
$ sap-cloud-sdk init --addCds
# Set up SAP CAP without initializing
$ sap-cloud-sdk add-cds
```

#### Frontend Scripts

Add frontend-related npm scripts which are executed by Project "Piper".
This is only needed if your project serves the frontend and you use Project "Piper" for your pipeline.
**By default, this configuration is not added.**

```bash
$ sap-cloud-sdk init --frontendScripts
```

#### Force, Help, and Verbose

- `--help` or `-h`: Show help for the `init` command.
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Show more detailed output.
- `--force`: Do not fail if a file or npm script already exists and overwrite it.

### Step-by-Step

#### Enter Project Name

The project name is relevant for the Cloud Foundry repository.
Your application will use this name to appear in the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit.
By default, it will suggest the name of the project folder.

#### Enter the Command to Start Your Application

When deploying to Cloud Foundry, it calls the entered command to start your application.
This can be any bash command.
Often the command will be `npm start`.

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI will add this command to the `manifest.yml`.
If you don't know the command at this moment, you can adjust it manually afterward.

#### Do You Want to Provide Anonymous Usage Analytics to Help Us Improve the SAP Cloud SDK?

If you give your consent, the SAP Cloud SDK will collect the following data about your project:

- project pseudonym
- Node.js version
- npm version
- operating system information
- project dependencies
- whether TypeScript is used

This helps us understand the ecosystem in which the SAP Cloud SDK is used and prioritize features accordingly.
The consent is stored in the `sap-cloud-sdk-analytics.json`.
To withdraw your consent, set `"enabled": false` or delete the `sap-cloud-sdk-analytics.json` file.

More information can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-cli/blob/main/usage-analytics.md).

```
$ sap-cloud-sdk init
  [...]
  âœ” Creating files
  âœ” Adding dependencies to package.json
  âœ” Installing dependencies
  âœ” Modifying `.gitignore`

+--------------------------------------------------------------+
 âœ… Init finished successfully.

 ðŸš€ Next steps:
 - Make sure that your app listens to `process.env.PORT`
 - Build your app if necessary
 - Run `sap-cloud-sdk package [--include INC][--exclude EXC]`
 - Push to Cloud Foundry (`cf push`)

 ðŸ”¨ Consider setting up Jenkins to continuously build your app.
 Use `sap-cloud-sdk add-cx-server` to create the setup script.
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Next Steps

After the initialization is finished, the CLI displays the necessary steps to deploy your application to Cloud Foundry.

#### Make Sure That Your App Listens To `process.env.PORT`

Your application may use a predefined listening port.
You can usually configure this in a central place like the `app.js` or `main.ts`.
If you are using an express-based framework, look for the `.listen()` function.

According to the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/node-tips.html) your app needs to listen to the `PORT` variable.

> You must use the PORT environment variable to determine which port your app should listen on.
> To also run your app locally, set the default port as 3000.
>
> ```
>   app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
> ```

#### Build Your App if Necessary

Before your application can be prepared for deployment, you may need to compile the code.
This is needed for any project that is built with TypeScript or Babel.

We recommend adding a build script in the `package.json`.
You can also use the `ci-build` script that is generated by the SAP Cloud SDK CLI as a placeholder.
If you use a [Project "Piper" pipeline](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/), the generated configuration will automatically call the `ci-build` script.

:::tip Productive Build

Many project generators add build scripts automatically.
If there are multiple scripts, pay attention to use the productive build.
Often this is done by adding a `--prod` flag (or removing `--dev`).

:::

#### Run `sap-cloud-sdk package`

Your repository will likely contain files that are not necessary to be uploaded when deploying.
The generated `manifest.yml` defines the `deployment` folder as the path that will be uploaded when calling `cf push`.
Calling `sap-cloud-sdk package` will copy the needed files to the `deployment` folder.
If you want to include or exclude certain files, you can use the `--include` and `--exclude` flags.
These flags support [glob patterns](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>).

You can find more information in [the article on this command](./package.mdx).

#### Push to Cloud Foundry

Once your project is prepared, you can use the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) to deploy your application.
You may need to log in to your Cloud Foundry account first.

Manual deployments via [cf push](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/push.html) can be helpful in the beginning but are strongly discouraged for productive environments.
Those deployments should be done by a CI/CD pipeline that ensures successful tests before deployment.

## Set Up a New Project With the SAP Cloud SDK CLI

If the target directory does not exist or does not contain a `package.json`, the CLI will ask you if you want to create a new project.
The new project will be based on the Nest CLI.

```
$ sap-cloud-sdk init example-project
The target directory (example-project) does not contain a `package.json.`
Should a new `nest.js` project be initialized in the target directory? (y|n): y
```

The generated project uses TypeScript as a language, npm as the package manager, Nest as the backend framework and Jest as a test framework.
It also includes the most current version of the SAP Cloud SDK as a dependency.

:::note But I would rather use JavaScript!

If you prefer different tooling, we recommend you set up your project first and use the CLI to add the SAP Cloud SDK afterward.
