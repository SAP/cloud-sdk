The SAP Cloud SDK CLI adds necessary dependencies and configurations to add the SAP Cloud SDK deploy your app to SAP Cloud Foundry with one command.
This is possible for any existing project that uses `npm`.

If you are starting from scratch, the SAP Cloud SDK CLI can also generate a fully-loaded new project to get you started quickly.
This uses the CLI of our recommended backend framework [nest](nestjs.com) and enhances it with the SAP Cloud SDK.

## Add the SAP Cloud SDK to an Existing Project

You want to add the SAP Cloud SDK to your existing Node.js application?

You want to use the backend and testing frameworks you already know?

If you answered yes to either question, you can use the SAP Cloud SDK CLI to add the SAP Cloud SDK and necessary configuration to your project.
The command-line tool will take you step-by-step to create the right configuration for your project.

```bash
$ cd my-project

$ sap-cloud-sdk init
Enter project name (for use in manifest.yml) [my-project]:
Enter the command to start your application: npm start

  âœ” Adding dependencies to package.json
  âœ” Installing dependencies
  âœ” Modifying `.gitignore`
```

### Enter Project Name

### Enter the Command to Start Your Application

### Do You Want to Provide Anonymous Usage Analytics to Help Us Improve the SDK?

```
$ sap-cloud-sdk init
  [...]
  âœ” Creating files
  âœ” Adding dependencies to package.json
  âœ” Installing dependencies
  âœ” Modifying `.gitignore`

+--------------------------------------------------------------+
 âœ… Init finished successfully.

 ðŸš€ Next steps:
 - Make sure that your app listens to `process.env.PORT`
 - Build your app if necessary
 - Run `sap-cloud-sdk package [--include INC][--exclude EXC]`
 - Push to Cloud Foundry (`cf push`)

 ðŸ”¨ Consider setting up Jenkins to continuously build your app.
 Use `sap-cloud-sdk add-cx-server` to create the setup script.
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
```

After the initialization is finished, the CLI displays recommended next steps.

### Make Sure That Your App Listens To `process.env.PORT`

Your application may use a predefined listening port.
This can usually configured in a central place like the `app.js` or `main.ts`.
If you are using an express-based framework, look for the `.listen()` function.

According to the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/node/node-tips.html) your app needs to listen to the `PORT` variable.

> You must use the PORT environment variable to determine which port your app should listen on.
> To also run your app locally, set the default port as 3000.
>
> ```
>   app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
> ```

### Build Your App if Necessary

Before your application can be prepared for deployment, you may need to compile the code.
This is needed for any project that is built with TypeScript or Babel.

We recommend to add a build script in the `package.json`.
You can also use the `ci-build` script that is generated by the SAP Cloud SDK CLI as a placeholder.
If you use a [Project "Piper" pipeline](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/), the generated configuration will automatically call the `ci-build` script.

:::tip Productive Build

Many project generators add build scripts automatically.
If there are multiple scripts, pay attention to use the productive build.
Often this is done by adding a `--prod` flag (or removing `--dev`).

:::

### Run `sap-cloud-sdk package [--include INC][--exclude EXC]`

Your repository will likely contain files that are not necessary to be uploaded when deploying.
The generated `manifest.yml` defines the `deployment` folder as the path that will be uploaded when calling `cf push`.
Calling `sap-cloud-sdk package` will copy the needed files to the `deployment` folder.
If you want to include or exclude certain files, you can use the `--include` and `--exclude` flags.
These flags support [glob patterns](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>).

You can find more information in [the article on this command](./package.mdx).
