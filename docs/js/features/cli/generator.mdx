:::caution CLI is deprecated

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI is deprecated.
We'll provide replacement for key value adds of the CLI like project scaffolding, etc.

:::

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI wraps the generator available in the SAP Cloud SDK.
Right now the generator needs to be installed globally to be called through the CLI.
We are working to fully integrate the OData generator, the OpenAPI generator and the CLI.

To learn more about generation, check [the OData generator](../odata/generate-odata-client.mdx) and [the OpenAPI generator](../openapi/generate-openapi-client.mdx).
