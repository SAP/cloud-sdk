The SAP Cloud SDK CLI wraps the generator available in the SAP Cloud SDK.
Right now the generator need to be installed globally to be called through the CLI.
In the future the OData generator, the OpenAPI generator and the CLI will be integrated.

To learn more about generation, check [the OData generator](../openapi/generate-odata-client.mdx) and [the OpenAPI generator](../odata/generate-openapi-client.mdx).
