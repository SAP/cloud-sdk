The SAP Cloud SDK CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) to simplify common tasks you may encounter when working with the SAP Cloud SDK:

- [Adding the SAP Cloud SDK to an existing project](./init.mdx)
- [Creating a new project using the SAP Cloud SDK and other recommended dependencies](./init.mdx)
- [Generate an OData client](./generator.mdx)
- [Prepare your project for deployment to SAP Cloud Platform](./package.mdx)

## Installing the SAP Cloud SDK CLI

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI can be installed with npm.
We recommend to install the SAP Cloud SDK CLI globally.

```bash
$ npm install -g @sap-cloud-sdk/cli
```

Once the installation is complete, you can test if you have the newest version.

```bash
$ sap-cloud-sdk -v

@sap-cloud-sdk/cli/0.1.12
```

If you encounter any issue or want to look at the source code, look at [our GitHub page](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-cli).

:::info Caret Dependencies below 1.0.0

The SAP Cloud SDK CLI is currently below version 1.
Due to the behavior of global dependencies in npm, you need to run `npm install -g @sap-cloud-sdk/cli@latest` to update to the latest version.
