## What OData Protocol Versions Are Supported?

| OData protocol version          | SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [OData v2](odata-v2-client.mdx) | &#10003;                     |
| [OData v4](odata-v4-client.mdx) | &#10003;                     |

## What Is OData?

[OData](https://www.odata.org/) is an open standard for building and consuming RESTful APIs.
It defines a query language to send and retrieve data via HTTP and to perform operations on data.

There are two widely used versions of the protocol: OData v2 and OData v4.
The latter comes with more and improved functionality.
Full details on the standards are to be found in the [documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/).

## What Does the SAP Cloud SDK Offer?

The SAP Cloud SDK simplifies the consumption of OData services through the following features:

### Type-Safe OData Client

- We provide a type-safe OData client to build and execute OData requests in JavaScript and TypeScript.
- We ship pregenerated OData clients for the SAP S/4HANA OData services.
  They are also referred to as the _Virtual Data Model_ or _VDM_.
  You can find a list of all those services in the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPS4HANACloud?section=Artifacts) (check the OData box).
- We support both OData v2 and OData v4 protocols in the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.

### Code Generator

If you want to use an OData service, that has no pregenerated client, you can use the [client generator](generate-odata-client.mdx) to generate your own client.
You can do it for any service either developed by yourself, provided by SAP, or other 3rd parties.

- Service definition usually comes in form of the `.edmx` file and contains metadata of OData service.
  The simplest way to obtain it if you have access to the service is navigating to the `http(s)://<service-path>/$metadata` endpoint.
  You can generate a client for any 3rd party service or a service that you have built on your own.
- You can invoke code generator via our command-line interface (CLI).

### Connectivity

We simplify connectivity to SAP enabled OData services via type-safe abstractions over [Destinations](../connectivity/destination), Authentication and some other related concepts.
