:::note Troubleshooting
For some OData function or action imports, the `execute()` method might be missing as intended.
Typically, this might happen when an entity type is shared by multiple entity sets and is used as the return type of function/action imports.
You can then use `executeRaw` for getting the raw response and deserialize by your own.
