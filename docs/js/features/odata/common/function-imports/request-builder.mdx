The [function imports request builder](pathname:///api/1.28.1/classes/sap_cloud_sdk_core.functionimportrequestbuilderv2) helps build a request for a service operation containing parameters in a type-safe way.
This time, as an example, the [`Warehouse Outbound Delivery Order Service`](https://api.sap.com/api/API_WHSE_OUTB_DLV_ORDER/resource) is used, because not all the services contain function imports like the `Business Partner Service`.
The type-safe client for the `Warehouse Outbound Delivery Order Service` can be found in the package `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-warehouse-outbound-delivery-order-service`.

The example below creates a function import request builder for the service operation `PostGoodsIssue` and then execute it against your service.

```ts
postGoodsIssue({ outboundDeliveryOrder: 'order' }).execute(destination);
```

The service operation is defined in the service metadata.

If the response structure does not match the transformation type, the promise from `execute(destination)` will be resolved into `undefined`.

The default transformer expects the following response format:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Count": 0
  }
}
```

Assume the actual response has an additional layer `Foo`:

```json
{
  "d": {
    "Foo": {
      "Count": 0
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, `dataAccessor` can be used in the following way to modify the response into the desired form for further deserialization.

```ts
functionImportRequestBuilder.execute(
    destination,
    data => data.d.Foo
);
```
