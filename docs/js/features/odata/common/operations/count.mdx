The method `count()` allows you to get the number of elements in a collection.
It is only available for  `getAll()` requests and is added before the request execution:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().getAll().count();
```

The return type of count requests is a `Promise<number>`.
You can combine the `count()` with filter conditions.
To get the number of business partners with first name `John` execute the following request:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().filter(BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('John')).count().getAll();
```

As defined in the OData spec `count` is not affected by `top`, `skip`, and `orderBy`.
:::note `top()` and `skip()` are ignored for count
If you include these methods in a count request they will be ignored by the SDK.
So these three requests:

```
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().top(5).getAll().count();
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().skip(5).getAll().count();
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().getAll().count();
```

will all return the same value.
