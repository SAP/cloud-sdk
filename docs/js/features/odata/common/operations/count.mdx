The method `count()` allows you to get the number of elements in a collection.
It is only available for  `getAll()` requests and is added before the request execution:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().count().getAll();
```

The return type of count requests is a `Promise<number>`.
You can combine the `count()` with filter conditions.
To get the number of business partners with first name `John` execute the following request:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().filter(BusinessPartner.FIRST_NAME.equals('John')).count().getAll();
```

Note that we currently do not support the usage of count within a filter condition as described in the [OData v4 specifiation](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html#sec_AddressingtheCountofaCollection).
As defined in the OData spec `count` is not affected by `top`,`skip` and `orderBy`.
If you include these methods in a count request they will be ignored by the SDK.
So these three requests:

```
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().top(5).count().getAll();
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().skip(5).count().getAll();
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().count().getAll();
```

will all return the same value.
