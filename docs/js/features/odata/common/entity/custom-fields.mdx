In the real world, OData service implementations can differ from their original service specifications.
This can happen due to incorrect specifications or customizations of the service.
The SAP Cloud SDK supports custom fields on your entities, that are not covered by the specification the according service is based on.

You can set custom fields on an entity through the `.setCustomFields` and `.setCustomField` methods.
Setting custom fields with existing keys overrides the existing fields.
Non-existent fields are added without removing other fields.

```ts
// add custom fields to the existing fields
businessPartner.setCustomFields({
  myCustomField: 'this is custom'
});

// add specific custom field
businessPartner.setCustomField('myCustomField', 'this is custom');
```

You can also access existing fields using the `.getCustomField` and `.getCustomFields` methods.

```ts
// get all custom fields
const customFields = businessPartner.getCustomFields(); // { myCustomField: 'this is custom' }

// get specific custom field
const customFields: = businessPartner.getCustomField(); // 'this is custom'
```

:::note Custom fields are not serialized or deserialized

As custom fields are not defined through the service specification, the type of their values is unknown.
Therefore, custom fields are never automatically serialized or deserialized.
If you are using custom fields, you might have to take care of serialization on your own.
