A retrieve request is any HTTP `GET` request.
In terms of the SAP Cloud SDK this includes all requests built by a [`GetAllRequestBuilder`](#getall-request-builder) and [`GetByKeyRequestBuilder`](#getbykey-request-builder).

Retrieve requests can be passed directly to the `batch` function, which in turn can be executed once to execute all subrequests.
Once a batch request is executed, it returns a list of `BatchResponse`s.
Those contain the raw response information of each subrequest, the subresponse to a retrieve subrequest can either be a `ReadResponse` or an `ErrorResponse`.
To determine if a request was successful use `.isSuccess()`.

Successful requests can be cast to `ReadResponse` which contains the HTTP code, the raw body, and the constructor of the entity that was parsed from the response.
To work with an instance of the retrieved entity, you can use the `.as` method, which allows you to transform the raw data into an instance of the given constructor.
Note, that retrieve responses can be [`ErrorResponse`s](#error-handling).
Therefore, it is crucial to check responses for success, before casting them to `ReadResponse`.

In the example below, each given address id is mapped to a [`GetByKeyRequestBuilder`](#getbykey-request-builder).
These retrieve requests are combined into one `batch` request and executed against a destination.

If one of the requests was not successful, an error will be thrown, otherwise, the responses are transformed into instances of `BusinessPartnerAddress`.
