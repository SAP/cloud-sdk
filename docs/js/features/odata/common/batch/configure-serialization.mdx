By default, URLs in the multipart representation of a request are serialized to a path relative to the service, e.g.:

```
GET /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
```

However, some services might only understand URLs relative to the entity or even absolute URLs.

To configure the serialization of the URLs within a batch request, you can set the subrequest path type with `withSubRequestPathType`.
You can either set it to `'relativeToService'`, as is the default, `'relativeToEntity'`, which will yield URLs relative to the entity, or `'absolute'`, which will produce absolute URLs.
See below for examples:

Serialize subrequest path relative to entity:

```ts
// GET /A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
batch(...requests).withSubRequestPathType('relativeToEntity');
```

Serialize subrequest path as absolute URL:

```ts
// GET https://my-s4.system.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
batch(...requests).withSubRequestPathType('absolute');
```
