A changeset is a collection of HTTP `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` operations - requests built by any [CreateRequestBuilder](#create-request-builder), [UpdateRequestBuilder](#update-request-builder) and [DeleteRequestBuilder](#delete-request-builder) in terms of the SAP Cloud SDK.
The order of execution within a changeset is not defined.
This differs from the whole batch request itself, where the order is defined.
Therefore the requests within a changeset should not depend on each other.
If the execution of any of the requests within a changeset fails, the whole changeset will be reflected as an error in the response and will not be applied, much like a database transaction.

Change requests cannot be passed to a batch request directly.
They have to be combined in a changset, which in turn can be passed to the batch request.
Once a batch request is executed it returns a list of `BatchResponse`s.
Those contain the raw response information of each subrequest.
The response to a changeset request can either be a collection of the subresponses to the subrequests of the changeset of type `WriteResponses` or an `ErrorResponse`.
To determine if a request was successful use `.isSuccess()`.

Successful requests should be cast to `WriteResponses` which contains all subresponses for the changeset request.
Those responses can be accessed by `.responses` and have the type `WriteResponse`.
Each `WriteResponse` contains the HTTP code and can contain the raw body and the constructor of the entity that was parsed from the response, depending on whether there was a body in the response.
Create and delete requests typically do not have a response body.
In order to work with an instance of an entity given in a `WriteResponse`, you can use the `.as` method, that allows you to transform the raw string body into an instance of the given constructor.
Note that the response may not exist, so you should only call this method if you know that there is data.
Typically the HTTP code is a good indicator for this (`201 No Content` probably won't have content).
If you are working with TypeScript you will have to tell the compiler, that the `.as!` method can be used here by adding a `!`.
Also note, that retrieve responses can be [`ErrorResponse`s](#error-handling).
Therefore, it is crucial to check responses for success, before casting them to `WriteResponses`.

In the example below, a list of addresses is mapped to [UpdateRequestBuilder](#update-request-builder)s.
These change requests are combined to one `changeset`, which is passed to the `batch` request and executed against a destination.

Once the batch request is exeucted it returns a list of `BatchResponse`s, which in this example contains one response only, namely the one for the changeset.

If the request was not successul, an error will be thrown, otherwise the subresponses are transformed to instances of `BusinessPartnerAddress`.

```ts
async function updateAddresses(
  businessPartnerAddresses: BusinessPartnerAddress[]
): Promise<BusinessPartnerAddress[]> {
  // Create update requests
  const updateRequests = businessPartnerAddresses.map(address =>
    BusinessPartnerAddress.requestBuilder().update(address)
  );

  // Execute batch request with one changeset
  const batchResponses = await batch(
    // Combine update requests into one changeset
    changeset(...updateRequests)
  ).execute(destination);

  // Get response for the changeset request
  const changesetResonse = batchResponses[0];

  // Error handling
  if (!changesetResonse.isSuccess()) {
    throw new Error('The changeset request was not successful.');
  }

  return (changesetResonse as WriteResponses).responses.map(response =>
    // Transform response to an instance of BusinessPartnerAddress
    response.as!(BusinessPartnerAddress)
  );
}
```
