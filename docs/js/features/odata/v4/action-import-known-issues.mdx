1. Similar to the `function import`, the `action import` does not support `Entity Type` as a parameter.
2. Also, we only support `unbound actions` for now.
   We plan to support `bound actions` in the future, please create a feature request [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=).
