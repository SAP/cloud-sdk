There are many reasons for errors to occur when developing software.
The SAP Cloud SDK tries to provide as much information as possible and necessary to understand what caused an error.
Generally speaking, there is no difference in handling errors when working with the SAP Cloud SDK.
However, some errors are caused by underlying errors.
In these cases, the SAP Cloud SDK throws an `ErrorWithCause`, that allows access to the immediate cause and root cause of this error.
These can be accessed by the `cause` and `rootCause` properties on `ErrorWithCause`.

In the example below we try to create a business partner against https://example.com as a destination.
As this is not an SAP S/4HANA system, this will fail and the error reveals the cause and root cause of the failure.

```ts
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .create(BusinessPartner.builder().build())
  .execute({ url: 'https://example.com' })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Error:', err.message);
    console.log('Cause:', err.cause?.message);
    console.log('Root cause:', err.rootCause?.message);
  });
```

The example above will yield the following output:

```bash
Error: Create request failed!
Cause: post request to https://example.com/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER failed!
Root cause: Request failed with status code 404
```

The final error is an `ErrorWithCause` that was caused by another `ErrorWithCause`.
The root cause is an `Error` and reveals that the requested URL does not exist.
