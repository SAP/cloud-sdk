## How to Use the Client

The API of the OpenApi clients are similar to the ones for [OData](../odata/execute-odata-request).
What methods are available in a client depends on the service specification.
We will use the [test service](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/test-resources/rest-service-specs/test-service.json) as an example to explain how the specification relates to methods in the generated client.

The test service is simple and has only three paths: `/entities`, `/entities/{entityId}` and `entities/count`.
The SDK will create meaningful names for these paths and operations automatically.
We will explain how the `GET` operation for the three paths are executed as well as the `POST` operations.
The central entry point to execute methods is the `TestServiceApi` object which provides all available methods.

### Get Operation without Parameters

The root path `/entites` in combination with the operation `GET` will get all entities and the method name is `getAllEntities`:

```ts
import {
   TestServiceApi
} from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const allTestEntities = await TestServiceApi.getAllEntities().execute(myDestination);
```

The type of `allTestEntities` is a `Promise<TestEntity[]>` and `myDestination` is the destination object explained in the [connectivity guide](./connectivity/destination).
The name of the `API` object derives from the OpenApi specification file name.
In this example it is called `test-service.json`.

### Get Operation with Parameter

The path `/entities/{entityId}` has a parameter.
With `GET` it will return the entity by the given key.
Hence, the SDK call the method `getEntityByKey`

```ts
import {
   TestServiceApi
} from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const myEntity = await TestServiceApi.getEntityByKey('myId').execute(myDestination);
```

Note that the result of this request is also typed as `Promise<TestEntity>`.

### Get Operations with longer Paths

The path `root/someThing` will get `someThing` from the root entity.
In our example we have a `entities/count` which will return the number of entities:

```ts
import {
   TestServiceApi
} from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const numberOfEntities = await TestServiceApi.countEntities().execute(myDestination);
```

where the type of the response is `Promise<number>`.

### Post Operations

For the `entities` path the operation `POST` is also allowed.
This corresponds to the creation of new entities.
You create a entity in the following way:

```ts
import {
   TestServiceApi,
   TestEntity
} from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const testEntity: TestEntity = {
      keyProperty: 'some-id-in-uuid-format',
      stringProperty: 'myProperty'
};
const createResponse = await TestServiceApi.createEntity(testEntity).execute(restDestination);
```

The `POST` operation is [specified](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/test-resources/rest-service-specs/test-service.json) to return no content and status code 201 (created).
Hence the `createResponse` is typed as `Promise<void>`.

:::note
If your server requires CSRF tokens for `POST` request you have to fetch and provide it manually as custom header in the `execute()` method, because the OpenApi clients to currently not support automatic token fethcing.
