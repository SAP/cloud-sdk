## How to Use the Client

The API of the OpenAPI clients are similar to the ones for [OData](../odata/execute-odata-request).
What methods are available in a client depends on the service specification.
We will use the [test service](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/test-resources/rest-service-specs/test-service.json) as an example to explain how the specification relates to methods in the generated client.

The test service is simple and has only three paths: `/entities`, `/entities/{entityId}` and `entities/count`.
We will explain how the `GET` operation for the three paths are executed as well as the `POST` operations.

The central entry point to execute methods is the `TestServiceApi` object which provides all available methods.
The name of the `API` object derives from the OpenAPI specification file name.
In this example it is called `test-service.json`.

### `GET` Operation Without Parameters

The root path `/entites` in combination with the operation `GET` will get all entities.
The SAP Cloud SDK uses the `operationId` value of the spec file to name the method if possible.
In the example the `operationId` is `getAllEntities` and the method is executed in the following way:

```ts
import { TestServiceApi } from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const allTestEntities = await TestServiceApi.getAllEntities().execute(
  myDestination
);
```

The type of `allTestEntities` is `Promise<TestEntity[]>` and `myDestination` is the destination object explained in the [connectivity guide](../connectivity/destination).

### `GET` Operation With Parameter

The path `/entities/{entityId}` has a parameter of type `string` and it will return the entity by the given key.
The `operationId` is `getEntityByKey` and the path parameter is passed as an argument:

```ts
import { TestServiceApi } from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const myEntity = await TestServiceApi.getEntityByKey('myId').execute(
  myDestination
);
```

Note that the result of this request is also typed as `Promise<TestEntity>`.

### `GET` Operations With Longer Paths

The path `root/someThing` will get `someThing` from the root entity.
In our example we have a `entities/count` which will return the number of entities and is named `countEntities`:

```ts
import { TestServiceApi } from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const numberOfEntities = await TestServiceApi.countEntities().execute(
  myDestination
);
```

where the type of the response is `Promise<number>`.

### `POST` Operations

For the `entities` path the operation `POST` is also allowed.
This corresponds to the creation of new entities.
You create a entity in the following way:

```ts
import { TestServiceApi, TestEntity } from './outputDirectory/test-service';

const testEntity: TestEntity = {
  keyProperty: 'some-id-in-uuid-format',
  stringProperty: 'myProperty'
};
const createResponse = await TestServiceApi.createEntity(testEntity).execute(
  restDestination
);
```

The `POST` operation is [specified](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/test-resources/rest-service-specs/test-service.json) to return no content and status code 201 (created).
Hence the `createResponse` is typed as `Promise<void>`.

:::note
If your server requires CSRF tokens for `POST` request you have to fetch and provide it manually as custom header in the `execute()` method, because the OpenAPI clients to currently not support automatic token fetching.
