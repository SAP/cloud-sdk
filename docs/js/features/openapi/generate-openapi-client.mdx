## Generate a Client via the Command-Line Interface

Many SAP systems like SAP S/4HANA, SAP Concur and SAP Cloud Platform provide REST APIs to the user.
A common way to specify these services is via [OpenAPI](./overview) specification files.
You can generate type-safe OpenAPI clients using these specification files with the SAP Cloud SDK.
An example how such a file looks like can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/test-resources/rest-service-specs/test-service.json) and is discussed in detail in the guide on [how to execute an OpenAPI request](./execute-openapi-request).

Run this command to install the OpenAPI generator globally:

```
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator -g
```

Then you can generate an OpenAPI client via:

```
generate-openapi-client -i directoryWithOpenApiFiles -o outputDirectory
```

The `directoryWithOpenApiFiles` points to the directory containing your specification file and `outputDirectory` to the target folder where the generated client will be saved.
For additional options on the command use the `--help` flag.

## Generate a Client Programmatically

The generator can also be executed programmatically in JavaScript code directly.
In the [generator package](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/openapi-generator) the a method `generateClients` is exported.
This method takes the same options as the command-line tool and generates OpenAPI clients:

```ts
import { generateClients } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator'

const generatorOptions = {
  inputDir: 'directoryWithOpenApiFiles';
  outputDir: 'myOutputDirectory';
}

generateClients(generatorOptions)
```
