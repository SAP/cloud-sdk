## Generate a Client

For the S/4 HANA OData APIs we have pregenerated clients and published them as npm packages.
For Rest clients we have not done this and you need to generate the clients on your own.

The first thing is to install the generator via:
```
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/XXX -g
```

Then you can generate a client via:

```
sap-cloud-sdk-XXX generate-XXX -i directoryWithOpenApiFiles -o outputDirectory
```

For additional options use the `--help` flag on the command.

## Call the Generator Programmatically

In case you want to generate clients not via the command line but via code you can also call the generator directly.
In the [generator package](XXX) the a method `generateClients` is exported.
This method can be used to generate clients:

```ts
import { generateClients } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/XXX'

const generatorOptions = {
  inputDir: 'directoryWithOpenApiFiles';
  outputDir: 'myOutputDirectory';
}

generateClients(generatorOptions)
```
