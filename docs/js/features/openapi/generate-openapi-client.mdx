## Generate a client via the CLI

Many SAP systems like SAP S/4HANA, Concur and Sap Cloud Platform provide REST APIs to the user.
A common way to specify these services is via [OpenApi](../overview) specification files.
You can generate typesafe OpenApi clients using these specification files with the SDK.
An example how such a files looks like can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/blob/main/test-resources/rest-service-specs/test-service.json) and is discussed in detail in the [execute OpenApi request](./execute-openapi-request) section.

Run this command to install the OpenApi generator globally:
```
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator -g
```

Then you can generate an OpenApi client via:

```
generate-openapi-client -i directoryWithOpenApiFiles -o outputDirectory
```

The `directoryWithOpenApiFiles` points to the directory containing your specification file and `outputDirectory` to the target folder wheere generated client will be saved.
For additional options on the command use the `--help` flag.

## Generate a client programmatically

The generator can also be execute programmatically in JavaScript code directly.
In the [generator package](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/packages/openapi-generator) the a method `generateClients` is exported.
This method takes the same options as the command line tool and generates OpenApi clients:

```ts
import { generateClients } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator'

const generatorOptions = {
  inputDir: 'directoryWithOpenApiFiles';
  outputDir: 'myOutputDirectory';
}

generateClients(generatorOptions)
```
