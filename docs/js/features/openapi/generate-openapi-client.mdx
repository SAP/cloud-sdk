## Generate a Client via the CLI

For the SAP S/4HANA OData APIs we have pregenerated clients and published them as npm packages.
For Rest clients we have not done this and the clients need to be generated.

Run this command to install the generator globally:
```
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/XXX -g
```

Then you can generate an OpenApi client via:

```
sap-cloud-sdk-XXX generate-XXX -i directoryWithOpenApiFiles -o outputDirectory
```

For additional options on the command use the `--help` flag.

## Generate a Client Programmatically

The generator can also be execute programmatically in JavaScript code directly.
In the [generator package](XXX) the a method `generateClients` is exported.
This method takes the same options as the command line tool and generates OpenApi clients:

```ts
import { generateClients } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/XXX'

const generatorOptions = {
  inputDir: 'directoryWithOpenApiFiles';
  outputDir: 'myOutputDirectory';
}

generateClients(generatorOptions)
```
