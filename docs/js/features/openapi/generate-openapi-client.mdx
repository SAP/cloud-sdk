:::note
The OpenAPI generator is currently beta. We do not recommend to use it in production as there might still be breaking changes.
:::

Many SAP systems like SAP S/4HANA, SAP Concur and SAP Business Technology Platform provide their services through REST APIs.
A common way to specify these services are [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/).
With the SAP Cloud SDK, you can generate typed clients for those specifications.

## Installation

Run this command to install the OpenAPI generator globally:

```sh
npm install -g @sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator
```

## Generate a Client Using the Command Line Interface

The SAP Cloud SDK generator is primarily intended to be used on the command line.
You can generate an OpenAPI client by running:

```sh
generate-openapi-client --inputDir <inputDirectory> --outputDir <outputDirectory>
```

The `<inputDirectory>` points to the directory containing your specification file(s) and `<outputDirectory>` to the target folder where the generated client(s) will be saved.

By default the generated clients will each contain:

- API files as `.ts` files - one for each "API" in the service.
  See [details](#how-the-api-code-is-generated).
- A schema directory, containing schema files (`.ts`), one for each schema defined in the service specification.
- All of the above as transpiled sources, including JavaScript sources (`.js`), type definition files (`.d.ts`) and sourcemap files (`.js.map` and `.d.ts.map`).
- A `package.json`.
- A `tsconfig.json`.

The generation always includes the TypeScript sources.
All other files can be excluded from the generation - see the options below.

## Options

Run `generate-openapi-client --help` for additional options.

It can also be set to a specific version.                                                                   |

## Generate a Client Programmatically

The generator can also be executed programmatically in JavaScript or TypeScript code.
Add the `@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator` package to your project:

```sh
npm i @sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator
```

This package exports the `generate` function.
It takes the same options as the command-line tool and generates the same files:

```ts
import { generate } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi-generator'

const generatorOptions = {
  inputDir: 'directoryWithOpenApiFiles';
  outputDir: 'myOutputDirectory';
}

await generate(generatorOptions);
```

## How the API Code is Generated

By default the generator produces one service directory for every OpenAPI specification.
The directory name is based on the file name of the specification and is transformed to kebab case, e.g. `my-service`.

### APIs

All operations of the service are grouped into APIs based on their tags.
A service can consist of multiple APIs.
If multiple tags are specified for an operation, only the first one is considered.
If no tags are specified, "default" is used.

The API names are transformed by appending "Api" and transforming them to pascal case, e.g. 'my-tag' results in `MyTagApi`.
In case the tag already ends with "api" (case independent), one "Api" will be removed, e. g. `myapi` results in `MyApi`.
If your tags end with "api", but this is part of the word, e.g. "okapi", we recommend to use the OpenAPI vendor extensions and provide an explicit API name ending with "Api", e.g. "OkapiApi".
Note, that operations are grouped into APIs based on their transformed names, not the original names.
Therefore tags like "my-tag" and "MyTag" are treated as the same API, "MyTagApi".

### Operations

Every operation in the specification is reflected as a function of a generated API.
The function names are based on the `operationId` property in the specification of the operation.
If no `operationId` is given, the name is derived from the method and the path pattern, examples:

- `'resource'` with `post` would result in `createResource`
- `'resource/{id}'` with `get` would result in `getResourceById`

The function names are transformed to camel case, e.g. 'myFunction'.
Duplicates within an API are handled by adding an index at the end of the name.
In cases where we have duplicate names, but one of the names is in camel case, this name remains as is.
Example:

| Original `operationId`s | Generated function names |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `my-function`           | `myFunction2`            |
| `myFunction`            | `myFunction`             |
| `other_function`        | `otherFunction`          |

### Configure Generated Client Structure and Naming

In case you need more flexibility when generating clients, you can use the SAP Cloud SDK's vendor extensions for OpenAPI.
We provide two extenstions: [x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name](#x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name) to configure the structure and naming of the generated APIs and [x-sap-cloud-sdk-operation-name](#x-sap-cloud-sdk-operation-name) to configure the generated function names.
You can set those on different levels of the specification.
They take precedence before the default behavior.

#### x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name

Use this extension to configure the structure of your generated APIs.
Setting `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name` as a property determines which operations are grouped into one API.
Note, that the name will be transformed to pascal case with an "Api" ending, same as in the default behavior, e.g. "MyApi".
When referring to the "API name", the transformed name is meant.

This extension can be set on the following levels:

- operations - Operations that have the same API name are grouped into one API.
- on the path definitions - All operations below paths with the same API name are grouped into one API.
- root of the specification - All operations in the specification belong to the specified API.
  You can think of this as the custom default name for an API.

This extension can be set on all of these levels in the same document.
In these cases the most specific use of the extension takes precedence.

#### x-sap-cloud-sdk-operation-name

Use this extension to overwrite the default names for the generated functions.
As of the OpenAPI specification, this is the intent of the `operationId` field.
However, the value of this property has to be unique throughout a specification file.
Many OpenAPI validators fail if there are duplicate `operationId`s.
With the approach of the SAP Cloud SDK OpenAPI generator this restriction might overcomplicate APIs.
Given that you have multiple APIs, it can make sense to have the same function names in different APIs, e.g. `MyResource1Api.getAll()` and `MyResource2Api.getAll()`.
The purpose of the `x-sap-cloud-sdk-operation-name` is to allow using duplicate names across APIs, while complying with the OpenAPI specification.
