## What Is the OpenAPI Generator and What Does It Offer to You

The OpenAPI generator is a command-line tool to generate clients from an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
OpenAPI specifications are the standard to define RESTful web service in a language-agnostic way comparable to the `edmx` service definition for [OData clients](../odata/overview.mdx).
As you would expect, an [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) already exists which offers client generation for a big number of languages.
Why do we provide an extra generator in the SAP Cloud SDK?

We provided a generator based on the existing `openapi-generator` to integrate the connectivity layer of the SAP Cloud SDK for other REST APIs.
So the same [destination lookup](../connectivity/destination), [on-premise connectivity](../connectivity/on-premise) and [proxy handling](../connectivity/proxy) applies to the OpenAPI clients.

This is achieved in the following way.
We use the open-source generator to create an [axios client](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators/typescript-axios.md).
Then we include the request configuration, built with the SAP Cloud SDK, to this axios client.
The request configuration contains all headers, proxy and http-agent information relevant for connectivity.
In addition, we wrap the paths and operations with an API layer to have similar names as in the OData client.

If you are interested in using an OpenAPI client in your project, find more information in the guides on [the generation of a client](./generate-openapi-client) and [the usage of the client](./execute-openapi-request).
