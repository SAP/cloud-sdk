The OpenAPI generator is a command-line tool to generate clients from [OpenAPI specifications](https://swagger.io/specification/).
OpenAPI specifications are the standard to define RESTful web services in a language-agnostic way.
It is comparable to the `edmx` service definitions for [OData clients](../odata/overview.mdx).
The generated OpenAPI clients make use of the SAP Cloud SDK's connectivity layer.
That means, that the mechanisms for [destination lookup](../connectivity/destination), [On-premise connectivity](../connectivity/on-premise) and [proxy handling](../connectivity/proxy) are applied when consuming services through the generated clients.

As you would expect, an Open Source [OpenAPI generator (OpenAPITools)](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) already exists.
It offers client generation for various programming languages, including TypeScript.
The main difference between the generator by the SAP Cloud SDK and the generator by OpenAPITools is the aforementioned use of the SAP Cloud SDK's connectivity layer.
Further, the OpenAPITools generator requires a Java runtime environment to be used.
This is not required by the SAP Cloud SDK's generator.
As it is written in TypeScript it requires a Node.js environment.

If you are interested in using an OpenAPI client in your project, find more information in the guides on [the generation of a client](./generate-openapi-client) and [the usage of the client](./execute-openapi-request).
