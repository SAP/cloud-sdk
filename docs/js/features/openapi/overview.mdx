[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard is a popular format to define RESTful APIs.
Together with [OData](../odata/overview.mdx) it is one of the key API definition formats used at SAP.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient tooling to make the consumption of OpenAPI services easy and convenient.
For that we developed an [OpenAPI code generator](generate-openapi-client.mdx) from the ground up.
It's a command line tool capable of converting any OpenAPI specification into a TypeScript or JavaScript client library that is nicely integrated with other SAP Cloud SDK features like [connectivity](../connectivity/destination.mdx) and other abstractions for the SAP Business Technology Platform.
You can use the OpenAPI generator to create a client for the OpenAPI-based API service.
We support OpenAPI versions 2.0 and 3.0.
If you encounter any problems or errors with OpenAPI tooling give us feedback via our [support channels](../../../overview/support.mdx).

### Pregenerated OpenAPI Client

We're working with service publishers on releasing OpenAPI client libraries.
Stay tuned and follow our release notes for more details.

Another way to get a client library is to [generate it yourself](generate-openapi-client.mdx) based on API specifications available on the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/).

## Why Using SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript With OpenAPI Services?

- You'll benefit from less code boilerplate and better developer experience.
- We take care of various complexities around the development of applications and extensions on the SAP Business Technology Platform.
- You'll get convenient abstractions for Destinations, Authentication, Service bindings, CSRF and ETag tokens, Headers, and much more.
- We hide the complexities of cloud development making many tasks ridiculously easy.
- You're getting best in class [support from the SAP Cloud SDK](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new/choose) development team.
- We take care of change management by continuously updating, integrating, and shipping the latest version of services that we release.
- Our documentation is written by developers for developers.
  We keep it relevant and up to date.
