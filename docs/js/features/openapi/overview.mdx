## What Is the OpenAPI Generator and What Does It Offer to You

The OpenAPI generator is a command line tool to generate clients from an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).
OpenAPI specifications are the standard to define RESTful web service in a language-agnostic way comparable to the `edmx` service definition for [OData clients](../odata/overview.mdx).
As you would expect an [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) which offers client generation for a big number of languages already exists.
So why do we provide an extra generator in the SAP Cloud SDK?

The reason we provided an extra generator based on the existing one is that we wanted to include the connectivity layer of the SAP Cloud SDK for other REST APIs as well and not only for OData.
So the same [destination lookup](../connectivity/destination), [on-premise connectivity](../connectivity/on-premise) and [proxy handling](../connectivity/proxy) applies to the OpenAPI clients.

This is achieved in the following way.
We use the open source generator to create an [axios client](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators/typescript-axios.md).
Then we include the request configuration build with the SAP Cloud SDK to this axios client.
The request configuration contains all headers, proxy and http-agent information relevant for connectivity.
In addition we wrap the paths and operations with an API layer to have similar names as in the OData client.

If you are interested in using an OpenAPI client in your project the next steps to do are to generate a client and to use it in your project.
You find information in the guides on [the generation of a client](./generate-openapi-client) and [the usage of the client](./execute-openapi-request).
