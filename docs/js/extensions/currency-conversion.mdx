Overview
Currency Conversion is an extension library built on SAP Cloud SDK. You can use this library to facilitate currency exchange rate conversions.

:::note The library does not provide any market data out-of-the-box. You must provide the currency exchange rates to the library from your own data sources. You can use the SAP Market Rates Management service or any other of your choice. :::

You can use the library for the following functions:

Direct one-to-one conversions, from a source currency to a target currency.
Indirect conversions by using inverse rates or a "reference currency".
Fixed rate conversions, for when you have the exact currency exchange rate that you want to use in your conversion operations.
Non-fixed rate conversions, for when you have a set of exchange rates, as opposed to the exact rate. The library will pick the "best rate" from the set depending on various factors.
