## Overview

Currency Conversion is an extension library built on SAP Cloud SDK.
You can use this library to facilitate currency exchange rate conversions.

:::note
The library does not provide any market data out-of-the-box.
You must provide the currency exchange rates to the library from your own data sources.
You can use the [SAP Market Rates Management](https://www.sap.com/products/market-rates-management.html) service or any other of your choice.
:::

You can use the library for the following functions:

- Direct one-to-one conversions, from a source currency to a target currency.
- Indirect conversions by using inverse rates or a "reference currency".
- Fixed rate conversions, for when you have the exact currency exchange rate that you want to use in your conversion operations.
- Non-fixed rate conversions, for when you have a set of exchange rates, as opposed to the exact rate.
  The library will pick the "best rate" from the set depending on various factors.
