## Quick Start

For a quick start check out the [getting started](getting-started) section.

## Why the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript?

The SAP Cloud SDK supports you end-to-end when developing applications that communicate with SAP solutions and services such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, and many others.

Using the SAP Cloud SDK, you can reduce your effort when developing an application on SAP Business Technology Platform by building on best practices delivered by the SAP Cloud SDK.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides Java libraries, JavaScript libraries, project templates, and a continuous delivery toolkit.

## Difference to SAP OData library

There is a also a second open source library for consuming OData services developed by SAP.
The [SAP OData library](https://github.com/SAP/odata-library) is developed by a different team than the SAP Cloud SDK.
It evaluates service specification at runtime and helps you executing requests.
The table below tries to draw a line between the two open source libraries:

|OData library|SAP Cloud SDK|
|---|---|
|Supports JavaScript|Supports JavaScript and TypeScript|
|Operates dynamically on the metadata and creates an on-the-fly-client.| Uses pregenerated client at runtime. For many standard systems like S/4HANA, clients are available via `npm` or can be generated with the [generator](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx). |
|Connectivity needs to be handled manually.|SDK handles [connectivity](features/connectivity/destination.mdx) on BTP for you.|
