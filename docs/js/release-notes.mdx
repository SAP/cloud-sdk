## Should I Update?

We highly recommend to update to the latest SAP Cloud SDK version regularly.

It will help you:

- Ensure access to the latest SAP Cloud SDK features
- Keep up with the latest changes on SAP Cloud Platform
- Update client libraries giving access to the latest SAP services on SAP Cloud Platform and SAP S/4HANA.
- Protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

## Pregenerated Type-Safe Client Libraries (VDM)

:::tip What are client libraries?

For your convenience we [pre-generate type-safe client libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*) (also known as Virtual Data Model or VDM for short) for allow-listed OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Marketing Cloud and SAP S/4HANA On-premise.
These libraries are not Open Source, but free and distributed under the SAP Developer license through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*).

### Compatibility Notes

- A few operations were removed from the some SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2102 services. These operations were never supported by the SAP S/4HANA system (like CRUD support for some entities), so no existing functionality is affected. The following services are affected:
  <!-- vale off -->
  - _Nota Fiscal – Create, Update_ - `API_LOGBR_NOTAFISCAL_SRV`
  - _Purchase Contracts_ - `API_PURCHASECONTRACT_PROCESS_SRV`
  - _Outbound Delivery (A2X)_ - `API_OUTBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002`
  <!-- vale on -->
- The service `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-purchasing-inforecord-service` was renamed to `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-purchasing-info-record-service`.
