## Should I Update?

We highly recommend updating to the latest SAP Cloud SDK version regularly.

It will help you:

- Ensure access to the latest SAP Cloud SDK features
- Keep up with the latest changes on SAP Business Technology Platform
- Update client libraries giving access to the latest SAP services on SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP S/4HANA.
- Protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

:::note _Release notes_ for the Open Source components

For the Open Source modules of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript we maintain [release notes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/releases) on GitHub.

## Pregenerated Type-Safe Client Libraries (VDM)

:::tip What are client libraries?

For your convenience we [pregenerate client libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*) (also known as Virtual Data Model or VDM for short) for allow-listed OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Marketing Cloud and SAP S/4HANA On-premise.
These libraries are not Open Source, but free and distributed under the SAP Developer license through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*).
