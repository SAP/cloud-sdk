## Should I Update?

We highly recommend updating to the latest SAP Cloud SDK version regularly.

It will help you:

- Ensure access to the latest SAP Cloud SDK features
- Keep up with the latest changes on SAP Business Technology Platform
- Update client libraries giving access to the latest SAP services on SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP S/4HANA.
- Protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

:::tip What are pregenerated typed client libraries (VDM)?

For your convenience we [pregenerate client libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*) (also known as Virtual Data Model or VDM for short) for allow-listed OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and SAP S/4HANA On-premise.
These libraries are not Open Source, but free and distributed under the SAP Developer license through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*).
You can always generate a typed client library yourself by using our [OData](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx) and [Open API](features/openapi/generate-openapi-client.mdx) code generators.
To easily search for services and get typed client library for them, use our [API Business Hub integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/17/the-sap-cloud-sdk-integrates-with-the-sap-api-business-hub/).

## 1.28.2 [Client Libraries] - November 17, 2021

  You can discover all required API information via your IDE features like autocomplete and IntelliSense.

### New Functionality

## 1.52.0 [Core Modules] - November 5, 2021

[GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/releases/tag/v1.52.0) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap-cloud-sdk)

### Compatibility Notes

- We changed default cache isolation strategy from `IsolationStrategy.Tenant` to `IsolationStrategy.Tenant_User`.
  This applies when you set `useCache` to `true` while using a `getDestination` method for a destination lookup.

### Fixed Issues

- We now cache a destination only when a `JWT` contains all necessary information about a `Tenant` and a `User`.
  For example, when using `IsolationStrategy.Tenant_User`, the JWT has to contain both **tenant id** and **user id**.
- If `JWT` has an expiration time, we'll use it to override the default cache expiration time of 5 minutes.
- A **provider** token won't be used to retrieve a destination from cache from now on.
