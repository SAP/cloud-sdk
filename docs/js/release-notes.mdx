## Should I update?

We highly recommend to update to the latest SDK version regularly.
It will help you:

- ensure access to the latest Cloud SDK features
- keep up with the latest changes on SAP Cloud Platform
- update client libraries giving access to the latest SAP services on SAP Cloud Platform and SAP S/4HANA.
- protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

## Pre-generated type-safe client libraries

:::tip What are client libraries?
For your convenience we [pre-generate type-safe client libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*) (also known as VDM) for allowlisted OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Marketing Cloud and SAP S/4HANA On-premise.
These libraries are not Open Source, but free.
They are distributed under the SAP Developer license through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*).
