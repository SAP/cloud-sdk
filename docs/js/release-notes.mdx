## Should I Update?

## Pregenerated Type-Safe Client Libraries (VDM)

:::tip What are client libraries?

For your convenience we [pre-generate type-safe client libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*) (also known as Virtual Data Model or VDM for short) for allow-listed OData services of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Marketing Cloud and SAP S/4HANA On-premise.
These libraries are not Open Source, but free and distributed under the SAP Developer license through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*).
