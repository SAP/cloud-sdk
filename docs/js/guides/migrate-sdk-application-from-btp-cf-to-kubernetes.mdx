# How to Migrate a CloudFoundry Application to a Kubernetes Cluster
In this how-to, we will show step by step how you can migrate an application from CloudFoundry to Kubernetes.

It comprises of three steps:
1. First we decide what kind of environment to use. 
2. Then we prepare and setup our cluster with the sufficient services and service bindings.
3. Finally, we adapt our application to deploy to Kubernetes and consume services from within our Kubernetes cluster.

Choose the environment that satisfies your requirements:
- [Short PoC Environment](#short-poc-environments)
  - If you only do a short PoC this kind of environment will be sufficient for you. 
    But it is not recommended for future use or long running PoCs.
- [Staging Environments](#staging-environments)
  - For staging environments we will take a look at a way to create and bind services manually.
    This is primarily meant to try out different service setups.
- [Production Environments](#production-environments)
  - For production environments we will take a look at a way to create and bind services with reproducibility, longevity and developer simplicity in mind.


## Short PoC Environments
For a short PoC we can create and bind services in CloudFoundry, or preferably even use already existing service bindings.

### Prerequisites
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Create and Bind Services
If you want to create and bind _new_ services, you can deploy a `hello-world` app to CloudFoundry and then bind services to this app.
Once that is done, access the binding (which is in JSON format) and create a secret in Kubernetes out of it.

The secret has to be in YAML format like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: destination-service
type: Opaque
stringData:
  clientid: <client-id>
  clientsecret: <client-secret>
  url: <url>
  identityzone: <identityzone>
  tenantid: <tenantid>
  tenantmode: <tenantmode>
  verificationkey: <verificationkey>
  xsappname: <xsappname>
  uaadomain: <uaadomain>
  instanceid: <instanceid>
  uri: <uri>
```

Once you are done use `kubectl apply -f <your-binding>.yml` to create the secret in your cluster.

Now let's take a look how to adapt our application to consume services and deploy to Kubernetes, for this switch over to the [Deploy to Kubernetes](#deploy-to-kubernetes) section.
## Staging Environments
For a staging environment where you may just want to try out different services or service configurations it is fine to use the following setup.
### Prerequisites
- [`smctl`](https://github.com/Peripli/service-manager-cli)
- [svcat](https://svc-cat.io/docs/cli/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Configure the Service Manager
First, create a Service Manager instance in CloudFoundry with the `subaccount-admin` plan. 

To be able to use the Service Manager, you (or your peers) need to have the right privileges in CloudFoundry, for this you need to follow this:

In the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit, navigate to your subaccount and choose Security → Trust Configuration → SAP ID Service.
Assign the `Subaccount Service Administrator` role collection to your email address.

Next you need to login to the service manager control and register your cluster
```
smctl login -a https://service-manager.<cf-api-end-point> --param subdomain=<your-cf-subdomain>
smctl register-platform <name-you-want-to-give-the-cluster> kubernetes > service-manager-credentials.txt
```
Save the `service-manager-credentials.txt` somewhere save, as you will need it later on, especially the username and password.

### Broker Registration
To make the services available to us we need to register the service broker, in CloudFoundry called `Service Manager` to the service catalog `svcat`.

To do this with the `Service Manager`, we just need to install the service-broker-proxy with the following code:

```bash
helm repo add peripli 'https://peripli.github.io'

kubectl create namespace service-broker-proxy

helm install service-broker-proxy peripli/service-broker-proxy-k8s \
  --namespace service-broker-proxy \
  --set image.tag=v0.3.2 \
  --set config.sm.url=<service-manager-url> \
  --set sm.user=<service-manager-user> \
  --set sm.password=<service-manager-password>
```
After installing the proxy you have to wait a few seconds until the it is fully operational.
Once the proxy is working use `svcat marketplace`, all CloudFoundry services should now be listed.

### Create and Bind Services
Now we can create service instances with the service catalog, first let's create the destination service

```bash
svcat provision destination-service --class destination --plan lite
```

Notice how `destination-service` is just the name we give this particular service instance, it could be anything.

Now we could also create an XSUAA

```bash
svcat provision xsuaa-service --class xsuaa --plan broker
```

Finally we just need to bind the services to make them available to our application.

```bash
svcat bind destination-service
svcat bind xsuaa-service
```

Now let's take a look how to adapt our application to consume services and deploy to Kubernetes, for this switch over to the [Deploy to Kubernetes](#deploy-to-kubernetes) section.

## Production Environments
For production environments where you need transparency and reproducibility of the services that are running in your cluster, you should use the service operator. 
With the service operator, all services are deployed via YAML files, which makes the management of services a lot easier in the long term.

### Prerequisites
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Kubernetes Cluster with a LoadBalancer enabled, we recommend using [Gardener](https://dashboard.garden.canary.k8s.ondemand.com/)

### Configure Operator
To use the operator, you need at least basic TLS with a self-signed issuer,
for this, first you need to install the `cert-manager`, use

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/cert-manager.yaml
```

to deploy the `cert-manager` into your cluster then install the `cert-manager` CRDs with

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.4.0/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```

finally, add a self-signed issuer to your cluster for this you can use the following yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-cluster-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

After you deployed the self-signed issuer, the operator is ready for deployment.
To do this, first create a `Service Manager` instance in CloudFoundry with the `service-operator-access` plan.
After you've created an instance, you need to create a binding, when you obtain it, it should look similar to this:

```JSON
 {
     "clientid": "<clientid>",
     "clientsecret": "<clientsecret>",
     "url": "<url>",
     "xsappname": "<xsappname>",
     "sm_url": "<sm_url>"
 }
```

Once you have the binding use helm to deploy the operator:

```bash
helm upgrade --install sapbtp-operator https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator/releases/download/<release>/sapbtp-operator-<release>.tgz \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace=sapbtp-operator \
    --set manager.secret.clientid=<clientid> \
    --set manager.secret.clientsecret=<clientsecret> \
    --set manager.secret.url=<sm_url> \
    --set manager.secret.tokenurl=<url>
```

### Create and Bind Services
Now that the operator is running in your cluster, you can create services just like you would in CloudFoundry, but instead of the CloudFoundry UI, you need to use YAML files.

Here is an example creating and binding a destination service:

Creating an instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
    name: operator-destination-service
spec:
    serviceOfferingName: destination
    servicePlanName: lite
```

Binding the instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: operator-destination-service
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: operator-destination-service
```

Notice that the `name` under `metadata` can be anything you want it to be,
just be sure that the instance name matches the `serviceInstanceName` field in the binding.

Follow this pattern for all services your application needs.

Now let's take a look how to adapt our application to consume services and deploy to Kubernetes, for this switch over to the [Deploy to Kubernetes](#deploy-to-kubernetes) section.

## Deploy to Kubernetes
To deploy to Kubernetes we have to take a look at two topics, one is how do we deploy our application to Kubernetes, the second is how do we consume the services in our application from within Kubernetes, for this we will take a look at our
end-to-end application.

### Example App: Simple E2E Application 
For this example, we will take a look at our [e2e Kubernetes app](https://github.tools.sap/cloudsdk/k8s-e2e-app) app.
To figure out what has to be migrated we just have to take a look at the `manifest.yml`

```yaml
applications:
  - name: k8s-e2e-app
    path: deployment/
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: npm run start:prod
    random-route: true
    services:
      - destination-service
      - xsuaa-service 
```
From this we see that:
- We need a node environment
- We need 256MB of memory
- How to start the app
- What services we need create and bind

This information is very important in the following steps

### Dockerfile
First we need to create a `Dockerfile`, because all applications are run in `Pods` in Kubernetes, these `Pods` do all require Docker images.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:12-alpine

WORKDIR /workdir

COPY /deployment /workdir

RUN ["npm", "install", "--unsafe-perm"]

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
```

Here we use the information from the `manifest.yml`, such as the node environment, what to copy and what command to run to start the application.

### Deployment Yaml
Next we need to create a `deployment.yml` that contains the resources the application needs, the docker image, as well as registry secrets (in case your image was pushed to a private repository), and most importantly the service bindings we previously created.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sdkjs-e2e
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sdkjs-e2e  
    spec:          
      containers: 
      - name: sdkjs-e2e
        image: docker-cloudsdk.docker.repositories.sap.ondemand.com/k8s-e2e-app:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi" 
            cpu: "1000m" 
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        volumeMounts:
          - name: destination-volume
            mountPath: "/etc/secrets/sapcp/destination/operator-destination-service" 
            readOnly: true
          - name: xsuaa-volume
            mountPath: "/etc/secrets/sapcp/xsuaa/operator-xsuaa-service"
            readOnly: true
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
      volumes:
        - name: destination-volume
          secret:
            secretName: operator-destination-service
        - name: xsuaa-volume
          secret:
            secretName: operator-xsuaa-service
```

From the `manifest.yml` we know that the app roughly needed 256MB of RAM on CloudFoundry, since we can't tell yet how many resources the app needs on Kubernetes, just take it as a bare minimum (in the `requests` part) and make it possible to scale up with the `limits` part (in this case up to 512MB of RAM).

Notice that we used `imagePullSecrets`, which is using the `regcred` secret, the `regcred` secret contains our own registry credentials that we previously bound as a secret, you can do this either by writing a `secret.yml` or directly in the CLI (though this will be in your `.bashrc`) like this:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-username=<name \
  --docker-password=<password> \
  --docker-email=<email>
```

Finally, notice how we mount every service which we also had in the `manifest.yml`, in this case a destination service and an XSUAA.
To do this we use  `volumes` and `volumeMounts`.

It should follow this structure for `volumes`:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: <some-volume-name>
  secret:
    secretName: <name-of-service-binding>
```

Here we make a secret (in this case a service binding) available as a volume.
Next we need to mount this secret at a very specific path for it to be usable by us, for this we follow the `xsenv` path conventions.

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: <volume-name>
    mountPath: "/etc/secrets/sapcp/<service>/<service-name>" 
    readOnly: true
```

###  Deploy and Expose your application
To deploy your application, simply use:

`kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`

To access your application you have two ways, either you expose your application to the internet or port-forward to your local machine.

### Local Connection
`kubectl port-forward deployment <your-deployment> :3000` for local portforwarding (with `:3000` kubectl finds any available port on your local machine an forwards port 3000 of your deployment, since our app listens on port 3000 we use this port)

### Internet Facing Connection
For a quick setup you can use the following code, with this a specific IP and port will be exposed, this is not suitable for production environments, but sufficient for a PoC.

`kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --type="LoadBalancer"`

If you want to expose your cluster with a Domain, TLS and/or basic authentication (in case its not already built into your application), check out the [Configure TLS and obtain a Domain in Gardener](#configure-tls-and-obtain-a-domain-in-gardener) part for a `Gardener` setup or the general Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/) for a general setup.

## Create a CI/CD Pipeline
You can create a simple CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or change your existing pipeline.
In order to automatically deploy into the K8s cluster, two things are needed:

1. Automatic build and deployment of the docker image into the docker repository
2. Automatic re-start of the Kubernetes deployment

Step (1) can be achieved by building and pushing the docker image with a technical user.
For Step (2) we need a technical user that is entitled to manage the cluster deployment.

1. [Create a service account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/) in your cluster
2. Bind the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole to the service account (alternative: create a more strict role)
3. Obtain the _token_ and _CA certificate_ from the secret that is automatically created for that service account
4. Obtain the cluster API endpoint via `kubectl cluster-info` 

You can now use the service account in your automation to connect to the cluster:
```bash
kubectl config set-cluster gardener --server=<your-cluster-api-endpoint>
kubectl config set-context gardener --cluster=gardener
kubectl config use-context gardener
kubectl config view
kubectl --token=${{ secrets.KUBERNETES_SERVICE_TOKEN }} --certificate-authority <path/to/ca.cert> cluster-info
```

Once that is working use
```bash
kubectl --token=${{ secrets.KUBERNETES_SERVICE_TOKEN }} --certificate-authority <path/to/ca.cert> rollout restart deployment/<your-deployment-name>
```

to shut down all pods and restart them.
If your deployment is configured with `ImagePullStrategy: Always` this will pull the updated image and use it.

## Configure TLS and obtain a Domain in Gardener
### Prerequisites
- Enable the NGINX Ingress add-on for your `Gardener` cluster

The fastest way to enable TLS and obtain a domain for your application is to create a service, which contains your deployment and an Ingress, which handles the routing.
In `Gardener` you can already specify your desired domain and the TLS will be managed for you, more on that later.

First create a service that contains your deployment, as well as the exposed port of your application, for example us this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: sdkjs-e2e
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 3000
```

Next, check your shoot-cluster YAML for the currently configured DNS,
it should be a field that looks like this:

```yaml
spec:
  dns:
    domain: cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
```

since you have the NGINX Ingress enabled, all your desired domains have to follow the pattern `*.ingress.<your-dns>`, for example 

```yaml
e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
```

This is how your Ingress file should look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-ingress
  annotations:
    cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    - e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    secretName: secret-tls
  rules:
  - host: e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: sdkjs-e2e-svc
            port:
              number: 8080
```

Notice how our Ingress uses the `Gardener` annotations, which is important so that `Gardener` manages our TLS.

Next you can see in the `spec.tls.hosts` part that we expose 2 routes, the first one is just our default domain, it is important that this is our first domain, since the first domain is only allowed to be max. 64 characters long, followed by that the domains can be any size, but should follow the Ingress pattern.

Also, notice we specified `secretName: secret-tls`, in this secret, all TLS certificates will be saved by `Gardener`. Finally look at how we serve our service at the root of our subdomain, this way the service is exposed to the internet.

After a short delay, you should now have the mentioned routes as well as valid TLS.

## Configure Basic Auth
In case your application may doesn't have built in authentication, you can add basic auth in front of your Ingress.
1. Create a htpasswd file

```bash
htpasswd -c auth username
```

2. Create a secret out of this file

```bash
kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-file=auth
```

3. Add annotations to your Ingress, if we use the previous example, it should look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sdkjs-e2e-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: ingress-gate-auth
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm: 'Authentication Required - This services is protected.'
    cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    - e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    secretName: secret-tls
  rules:
  - host: e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: sdkjs-e2e-svc
            port:
              number: 8080
```

Notice how `ingress-gate-auth` is just the secret name containing our password and the text following the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm:` only contains a message which is prompted when asking for the credentials for the basic authentication.
Your basic authentication should now be functional and opening any path should open a authentication window.

## OnPremise Connectivity
:::danger
OnPremise connectivity in Kubernetes is currently only available internally, though this will change in the near future.
This documentation is therefore only ment for internal users.
:::

To connect to OnPremise systems inside a Kubernetes cluster, you need to use the `Connectivity Proxy`.
The following guide will show you what has to be done to create and use it.

### Basic Auth
1. You need to create a route the `Connectivity Proxy` will use, this route needs to have TLS enabled, to do so in Gardener, refer to our [Configure TLS and obtain a Domain in Gardener](#configure-tls-and-obtain-a-domain-in-gardener) section or if you are using a different cluster, to the general [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/).

Here is an example where we add our custom route `connectivitytunnel.*` to our TLS section, in Gardener this creates a certificate for this route automatically.

```yaml
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    - e2e.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    - connectivitytunnel.ingress.cloud-sdk-js.sdktests.shoot.canary.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
    secretName: secret-tls
```

2. Now we need to add our CA certificate to the JVM trust store of the `Cloud Connector`, the CA certificate is stored in the TLS secret, in our case we named it `secret-tls`.
To get the information inside the secret you can use the following code snippet:

```bash
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o go-template='
{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

In there should be a block prefixed with `ca.crt` copy this certificate into a file and then follow [this guide](https://connect2id.com/blog/importing-ca-root-cert-into-jvm-trust-store).

3. Create and bind the connectivity service with the `connectivty_proxy` plan, refer to the guide of us that is fitting your environment.
If you use the PoC environment just save the binding as a secret, use the below example, otherwise you need to retrieve the binding first and then format it in `JSON` to save it as a secret, for that you need to retrieve the secret's content first, you can use the previous code snippet for that.

Then save the `JSON` in a secret here is an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: connectivity-proxy-service-key
type: Opaque
stringData:
  connectivity_key: '{
    "clientid": "<client-id>",
    "clientsecret": "<clientsecret>",
    "xsappname": "<xsappname>",
    "connectivity_service": {
        "CAs_path":"/api/v1/CAs",
        "CAs_signing_path":"/api/v1/CAs/signing",
        "api_path":"/api/v1",
        "tunnel_path":"/api/v1/tunnel",
        "url":"https://connectivity.cf.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
    },
    "subaccount_id": "<subaccount_id",
    "subaccount_subdomain": "<subaccount_subdomain>",
    "token_service_domain": "<token_service_domain">",
    "token_service_url": "<token_service_url>",
    "token_service_url_pattern": "https://{tenant}.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token",
    "token_service_url_pattern_tenant_key": "subaccount_subdomain"
}'
```

Note that we used the `stringData` instead of `data` field, this way the content is base64 encoded for us and we don't have to do it ourselves.
This is a requirement of the connectivity proxy, since it can't consume the data of the secret in YAML format _yet_.

4. Now we need to download the CA certificate of the connectivity service and create a secret containing:
- The CA certificate of the connectivity service
- Our private key
- Our public certificate

The private key and public certificate are also stored in our TLS secret, use the previous code snippet to retrieve it from the secret and save them in seperate files.
Finally download the CA certificate with the following line:

```bash
curl https://connectivity.cf.sap.hana.ondemand.com/api/v1/CAs/signing -o connectivity_ca.crt
```

Now you can create the secret with this command:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic connectivity-tls --from-file=ca.crt=<your-connectivity-ca.crt> --from-file=tls.key=<your-private.key> --from-file=tls.crt=<your-public.crt> --namespace default
```

5. Create a secret that contains credentials which have access to the docker image that the `Connectivity Proxy` is using.

The image is located here: `deploy-releases.docker.repositories.sap.ondemand.com`

To create the registry secret use the following command:

```bash 
kubectl create secret docker-registry <your-registry-secret> \                                                                                                   ✔  12402  13:33:05
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password> \
  --docker-server=deploy-releases.docker.repositories.sap.ondemand.com
```

6. Create a `values.yml` containing the configuration that suites your desired operational mode, for the available operational modes refer to the [documentation](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/NGP/Operational+modes#Operationalmodes-Singletenantinatrustedenvironment).
For the specific content of the configuration refer to the [configuration guide](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=NGP&title=Configuration+guide).

Here is an example for the `Single tenant in a trusted environment` mode:

```yaml
deployment:
  replicaCount: 1
  image:
    pullSecret: "proxy-secret"
ingress:
  tls:
    secretName: "connectivity-tls"
config:
  integration:
    auditlog:
      mode: console
    connectivityService:

7. For your application to reach OnPremise destinations, it needs the proxy settings, currently these have to be added manually to the secret containing the service binding.

To do this, use the following code snippet:

```bash
kubectl edit secret <binding-name>
```

Now you have to add the fields `onpremise_proxy_host` and `onpremise_proxy_port` containing the host and port, e.g. `connectivity-proxy.<namespace>`(in our case `connectivity-proxy.default`) and port, e.g. `20003`.
Be aware that the values have to be encoded in base64, for example:
```yaml
onpremise_proxy_host: Y29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LXByb3h5LmRlZmF1bHQ=
onpremise_proxy_port: MjAwMDM=
```

8. Finally, add the binding to your `deployment.yml`, the same way you would add any other binding.
