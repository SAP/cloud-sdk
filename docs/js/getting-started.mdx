## What Is the SAP Cloud SDK

The SAP Cloud SDK is a set of libraries that helps you end-to-end when developing applications on SAP Business Technology Platform that communicate with SAP solutions and services such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, and many others.

## Starter projects

The SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript publishes starter projects for multiple scenarios in the [samples repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js).
Currently there are starter projects available for:
- SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Environment - [starter project](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/samples/cf-sample-application)
- SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Environment in combination with [CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/) - [starter project](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/samples/cds-sample-application)
- Plain Kubernetes with SAP Gardener - [starter project](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/samples/k8s-sample-application)
- Kubernetes with SAP Gardener package with Helm - [starter project](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js/tree/main/samples/helm-sample-application)

### Project Files and Folders

The project contains the following files and folders, among others, to get you started with the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript:

#### npm / Project

- **`package.json`**: Specifies dependencies, metadata, and user-defined scripts.
  The application comes with some predefined scripts and dependencies.
- **`.npmrc`**: The **`npm`** configuration file.
  The SAP Cloud SDK consists of some generic libraries, that are available as Open Source Software and typed client libraries for allow-listed SAP APIs like SAP S/4HANA and multiple others. These libraries are often referred to as the Virtual Data Model (VDM).
  In the scaffolding, we specify the registry for the `@sap` scope, where the VDM libraries are published.

#### TypeScript

- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for `TypeScript`. This is not needed in the plain `JavaScript` version.
- **`tslint.json`**: Configuration file for `tslint`.

#### Continuous Delivery

- **`Jenkinsfile`**: Jenkins pipeline definition file for quality assurance.
  It uses the [project "Piper" General Purpose Pipeline](https://www.project-piper.io/).

#### Cloud Foundry

- **`manifest.yml`**: The deployment descriptor file for `SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment`.

#### Local Development

- **`src/`**: Source code for the initial application.

#### SAP Cloud SDK Specific

- **`systems.json`+`credentials.json`**: Allows you to maintain destinations for testing purposes.
- **`sap-cloud-sdk-analytics.json`**: Only if you have agreed to usage analytics during the initialization of your project.
  You can find more information about anonymous usage analytics [in the CLI's repository](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-cli/blob/main/usage-analytics.md).

## Run the Project

To run the application locally, execute the following command:

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

This will start a local server in watch mode so that subsequent changes will automatically trigger a restart of the server.
Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you should get a `Hello, World!` in response.

## Deploy the Project on SAP BTP Cloud Foundry

### Prerequisites

The Cloud Foundry CLI comes in handy when you want to deploy your application to the SAP Business Technology Platform.
You can find installation instructions for all common platforms in the [`Cloud Foundry documentation`](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
We recommend using a package manager for that.
If you are using `chocolatey` on Windows, please find the instructions [here](https://chocolatey.org/packages/cloudfoundry-cli).

### Login

:::note
If you don't have an [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/) account you need to create one.
:::

To deploy our application, we first need to log in to Cloud Foundry in the SAP BTP using the `cf` CLI.
First, we need to set an `API endpoint`.
The exact URL of this API endpoint depends on the region your subaccount is in.
Open the [SAP BTP cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/) and navigate to the subaccount you are planning to deploy your application to.
Click on “Overview” on the left and you can see the URL of the API endpoint.

Copy the URL and paste it into the following command in your command-line:

```shell
cf api https://api.cf.<region>.hana.ondemand.com
cf login
```

### Before Deploying

Build your app if necessary.

### Deployment

To deploy your app, run:

```Shell
npm run deploy
```

This command will use your local sources for transpiling, packaging and deployment, but will omit packaging your local `node_modules` as those can be system dependent.
Dependencies will instead be installed automatically when deploying to Cloud Foundry.

The Cloud Foundry CLI will automatically pick up the `manifest.yml` of the project when deploying your application.
The file should look like this (where `<YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>` is replaced by the name you specified when initializing the project):

```YAML
applications:
  - name: <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
    path: deployment/
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: npm run start:prod
    random-route: true
```

- The specified `path` instructs Cloud Foundry to upload all the files from the `deployment/` folder.
- The command specified under the `command` attribute tells the `buildpack` what command to issue to start the application.

When everything works as expected, you should get output that looks something like this:

```shell
Waiting for app to start...

name:              <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
requested state:   started
routes:            <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
last uploaded:     Thu 21 Mar 14:05:32 CET 2019
stack:             cflinuxfs3
buildpacks:        nodejs

type:            web
instances:       1/1
memory usage:    256M
start command:   node index.js
     state     since                  cpu    memory        disk           details
#0   running   2019-03-21T13:05:47Z   0.0%   16M of 256M   126.8M of 1G
```

The application will be running at the `routes` URL, you can also make sure that the application works correctly by running the start command, this command can be different than the one shown above.

Should the application not work for whatever reason, you can call the following command to access the logs:

```Shell
cf logs <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME> --recent
```

## Additional Features

For productive use, your app should be linked to one or more databases and implement user authentication and authorization.

### Configure Destination

Login the [Cloud Cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com), navigate to your respective subaccount (in case of a trial account it should be called `trial`).
In the menu bar on the left, there should be a section `Connectivity` with an entry called `Destinations`.
Click `Destinations`. On the page that opens, click `New Destination` and fill in the details below.

For `Name`, choose a name that describes your system.
For example, we will go with `S4_SYSTEM`.

If you use the Business Partner mock server, enter for `URL` the URL that you have saved from the [previous step](#deployment) and use `NoAuthentication` for `Authentication`.
If you use an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, enter the systems URL in the `URL` field and choose `BasicAuthentication` as the authentication type.
This will make the fields `User` and `Password` appear.
Enter here the credentials of a technical user for your SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.

### Bind Destination Service

To allow the application to use the destination you have just configured, you will need to bind an instance of the destination service and an instance of the `XSUAA service` to your application.

To create an instance of the destination service, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cf create-service destination lite my-destination
```

This tells Cloud Foundry to create an instance of the destination service with service plan `lite` and make it accessible under the name `my-destination` on the SAP BTP.
We can now use the name to bind this service to our application.
To do this, open your `manifest.yml` and add a section called `services`, under which you can then add the name of the just created service.

The resulting `manifest.yml` should look like this:

```YAML
applications:
  - name: <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
    path: deployment/
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: node index.js
    random-route: true
    services:
      - my-destination
```

#### XSUAA Service

Secondly, we need an instance of the `XSUAA service`.
The `XSUAA service` is responsible for issuing access tokens that are necessary to talk to other services, like the destination service.
For this service, we will need a bit of extra configuration in the form of a configuration file.
Create a file called `xs-security.json` with the following content:

```JSON
{
  "xsappname": "<YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>",
  "tenant-mode": "shared"
}
```

The value for `xsappname` again has to be unique across the whole of SAP BTP, so make sure to choose a unique name or prefix.

Now, execute the following command:

```shell
cf create-service xsuaa application my-xsuaa -c xs-security.json
```

And, as before, add the newly created services to the services section of your `manifest.yml`.

The final `manifest.yml` should look like this:

```YAML
applications:
  - name: <YOUR-APPLICATION-NAME>
    path: deployment/
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    memory: 256M
    command: node index.js
    random-route: true
    services:
      - my-destination
      - my-xsuaa
```

Finally, we can replace the parameter of `execute` with an object whose key `destinationName` refers to the name of the destination we defined earlier.
If you chose a different name than `S4_SYSTEM`, make sure to use it here accordingly.

The new function now looks like this:

```ts
.execute({
  destinationName: 'Server'
});
```
