## Introduction

The SAP Cloud SDK is a versatile set of libraries and tools for developers to build cloud-native applications on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
The goal is to simplify working in the SAP ecosystem by abstracting the complexities of the SAP BTP and allowing you to focus on the application's business logic.
The SAP Cloud SDK is available in two flavors:

- [SAP Cloud SDK for Java](/docs/java/overview-cloud-sdk-for-java)
- [SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript](/docs/js/overview-cloud-sdk-for-javascript)

By choosing the SAP Cloud SDK, you also choose a curated set of standards and development best practices allowing for a resilient, agile, and streamlined software delivery process.

## Benefits & Capabilities

- Robust connectivity abstractions for SAP BTP for managing destinations, authentication, multitenancy, CSRF, ETags, and more.
- Type-safe client code generators for OData and OpenAPI services that seamlessly integrate with other SAP Cloud SDK value-adds.
- Modular design and high-level of extensibility
- Advanced cloud-native development patterns like resilience, caching, inherent multitenancy, etc.
- Support in [Business Application Studio](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html)
- First-class documentation and [support](./support.mdx)

For a complete overview of supported features, check out the [feature matrix](./feature-matrix.mdx).

## Open Source

The SAP Cloud SDK for [JavaScript / TypeScript](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js) is already open-source.
Feel free to look at our source code, integrate the SAP Cloud SDk into your apps, or contribute improvements.

## Well-Integrated With the SAP Cloud Development Ecosystem

The SAP Cloud SDK is well-integrated with the following SAP products and services:

- [SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-premise](https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html)
- [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/)
- [SAP SuccessFactors](https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm.html)
- [SAP Sales Cloud](https://www.sap.com/products/sales-cloud.html)
- [SAP Fieldglass](https://www.fieldglass.com/)
- [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/)
- [SAP Ariba](https://www.ariba.com/)
- [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform.html)
- Deploy with Confidence

## Products Using the SAP Cloud SDK

A few prominent products using the SAP Cloud SDK are:

- [SAP Cloud Application Lifecycle Management](https://support.sap.com/en/alm.html)
- [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)
- [SAP Cloud for Real Estate](https://www.sap.com/products/real-estate-facilities-mgmt-cloud.html)
- [SAP Portfolio and Project Management](https://www.sap.com/germany/products/project-portfolio-management.html)
- [SAP Business Technology Platform Workflow](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/WORKFLOW_SERVICE/Cloud/en-US)

## SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

The [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications.
It offers a consistent end-to-end programming model for full-stack development on SAP Cloud Platform.
CAP is recommended for:

- Building APIs (OData, REST, Messaging)
- Consuming and emitting Enterprise Messages for SAP S/4HANA

### SAP Cloud SDK & SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and SAP Cloud SDK are complementary tools to publish and consume APIs like OData and REST.
CAP plays more on the API and service publishing side, while SAP Cloud SDK deals more with API consumption and deployment of applications to SAP BTP.

CAP leverages some of SAP Cloud SDK features:

- Resilience
- OData V4 helpers
- SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment abstractions
- SAP Deploy with Confidence Abstractions
- Advanced [generic OData client](/docs/java/features/odata/generic-untyped-odata-client)

You can use the SAP Cloud SDK and CAP together in one project.
