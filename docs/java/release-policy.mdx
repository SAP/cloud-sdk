## Minor and Major Release Policy

We follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for our releases.

### Minor release schedule

Our regular **minor version** release happens every **two weeks**.
It includes new functionality, fixes, and maintenance updates that we communicate in the [release notes](./release-notes.mdx).

We change our release frequency rarely to:

  - Provide a **hot fix** patch to the latest minor version release if a critical fix is necessary.
  - To accommodate a longer development cycle we can extend an interval between **minor version** releases.

:::tip  "Upgrading between minor releases"

Usually, an upgrade between minor releases do not involve any effort.
All the changes are incremental.
We do not remove any deprecated code before next major release.

:::


### Major release schedule

We intend to release a new **major version** every **six months** to introduce significant feature upgrades, refactor existing features, and clean up deprecated code.

  - **Major version** release interval is indicative and can be extended.
  - We will announce planned date and scope of the next **major version** release in this [document](#planned-major-release-schedule) and [release notes](./release-notes.mdx) at least 3 months before the planned release date.

### Upgrading to a New Minor Version

- Upgrade to a new **minor release version** should not involve any effort because we do not introduce breaking changes.

### Upgrading to a New Major Version

- We provide a step-by-step upgrade guide for each major version.
- Following the upgrade steps should take less than a day of development effort regardless of the project size.

### Documentation

- The documentation is always up to date with the **latest major release**.
- We will use tabs to demonstrate a difference between the versions where required.

<Tabs groupId="version" defaultValue="major" values={[ { label: 'SDK 2.x', value: 'major' }, { label: 'SDK 1.x', value: 'deprecated' } ]}>

<TabItem value="major">

```

Major version documentation

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="deprecated">

```

Deprecated version documentation

```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

- We will maintain documentation for the two most recent versions.
- With every new major version release the oldest documented version is removed from the documentation portal.

:::tip

We will always provide a branch with the latest snapshot of the documentation before the major version release.
You can use that branch to host documentation for the earlier version locally.

:::

### Fixes and Maintenance

- We provide new features and fixes only for the **latest major release** of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.

### Support and feedback

We are happy to hear from you and usually respond within one day.
Check our [support channels](../overview/support.mdx) and chose the one that works best for you.
