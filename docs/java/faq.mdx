## General Questions

### How Often Do You Release a New SAP Cloud SDK Version?

We release [bi-weekly](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk/sdk-bom).
All the features that are _Generally Available_ or _Beta_ get into the next release.
You can find the latest SAP Cloud SDK version and the list of previous releases [here](release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) or on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk/sdk-bom).

### Do You Release Hotfixes?

Yes, we do.
They usually have a higher `patch` number according to [semver](https://semver.org/), i.e: 3.19.1 instead of 3.19.0.
Check our [release notes](release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) for more details.

### Should I Update With Every Release?

The general recommendation is _YES_.
This way you'll reduce the effort to keep up with the fast pace of cloud development.
We try to keep stable functionality consistent and explicitly notify about breaking changes.
Be cautious about using features annotated as _Beta_ because their API can change with every release.

### Which Java Versions Are Supported by the SAP Cloud SDK?

The SAP Cloud SDK itself is compatible with Java 8 and 11.
Other Java versions may work as well, depending on your setup, but are not yet tested by us.
Note that the SAP Business Technology Platform Cloud Foundry environment only supports Java 8 out of the box, but can be configured to also run with Java 11.
SAP Business Technology Platform Neo only supports Java 8.

### Can I Use Features Annotated as Beta in Production?

We **do not recommend** using the API that is marked unstable in the production code.
We do not guarantee any API compatibility for future updates and the features might be experimental.
You can use these features to test new functionality, provide us feedback, and plan migration steps when _Beta_ features are released as _General Availability_.

### I Think I Found a Bug in the SAP Cloud SDK, What Should I Do?

Please, report it to us via any available channel.
The preferred support channel is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sap-cloud-sdk).
You can also create an issue on the SAP Cloud SDK external GitHub repository or use the internal one if you're the SAP employee.

### I'm Creating a BCP Incident, What's Your Component Name?

Choose `XX-S4C-SDK` if you are reporting an issue via BCP.

## OData Related Questions

### What Versions of OData Protocol Do You Support?

We support OData v2 and OData v4 services.
You can use pre-generated client libraries supplied with the SAP Cloud SDK or generate your client from the SAP Cloud SDK specification.
[Find more details here.](features/odata/overview)

### Do You Support All OData Features?

We support most of the OData features that are exposed by SAP services.
However, the [OData specification](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) is huge and contains many features that would see rare to no use.
If you found a feature that you need, but it is not yet supported by SAP Cloud SDK for Java, please, make a feature request via email [cloudsdk@sap.com](mailto:cloudsdk@sap.com) or create an issue towards one of our repositories.

### I Receive an OData Error/Exception When Using SAP Cloud SDK for Java

You may see some errors while developing.
These errors are not always caused by flaws in the SAP Cloud SDK as we often see inconsistent OData protocol handling by different services.
Some of them even have known flaws for which we have workarounds.
If you can't solve your issue via debugging and experimenting, please, report your incident via [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sap-cloud-sdk) or our GitHub repositories.

## Open API Related Questions

### Do You Support RESTful Services?

Yes, we do support [OpenAPI 2.0 also known as Swagger](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/), and [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) specifications.
The latter is preferred.
Find documentation how to generate a [type-safe Open API client here](features/rest/generate-rest-client.mdx).
We also release pre-generated libraries in collaboration with service providers who release RESTful Open API services.
For details check an [overview](features/rest/overview).
For feedback or questions about our Open API offering, please, create an issue [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/issues).

## Questions About SAP Business Technology Platform

### Do You Support SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Environment?

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java has first-class support for [SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment](https://www.sap.com/germany/products/business-technology-platform.html).
We provide plenty of helpful abstractions for [connectivity](features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-destination-service) and authentication that make developing apps a pleasant and rewarding experience.
Let us know if you miss functionality of the SAP BTP for the Cloud Foundry environment in the SAP Cloud SDK for Java.

### Do You Support SAP Business Technology Platform - Neo?

We still provide full support for SAP Business Technology Platform Neo.
However, we do not recommend starting new projects with SAP BTP for the Neo environment, as the Cloud Foundry environment is better suited for apps and SAP S/4HANA extension development.
Also, for Neo we provide out-of-the-box support with only servlet based applications and not spring based applications.
