## Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface

To deploy your app developed with SAP Cloud SDK to [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform.html) you'll need Cloud Foundry command-line interface (CLI).
You can download latest release of DEB package [from the official CF GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) or follow [instructions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#installing-using-a-package-manager) to install it with you package manager: `apt-get`, `yum` and `homebrew` are supported.

After installing the CLI you might need to reload you shell before it becomes available.
To check if it works run:

```bash
cf
```

## Bind Your Command-Line Interface to an API Endpoint

Let's associate your Cloud Foundry CLI to your SAP account by providing an API endpoint and logging in with your account.

**Select endpoint depending on your region:**

- Europe <https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com>
- US East: <https://api.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com>
- US CENTRAL: <https://api.cf.us20.hana.ondemand.com>

To use a snippet for Europe run:

```bash
cf api https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
```

Provide your credentials for SAP BTP:

```bash
cf login
```
