This document outlines how you integrate the SAP Cloud SDK into an application based on the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) (referred to as CAP in the remainder).

:::success Check out the tutorial as well

While this document provides a general overview of this topic, we have published a practical [tutorial on SAP Developers](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cloudsdk-integrate-cap.html) which illustrates all steps on a comprehensive example.

:::

:::success Guide on the traditional Spring deployment

We provide a [guide](spring-boot-war-deployment) on how to leverage the traditional Spring deployment in conjunction with CAP.
That guide is applicable for your project if you need to invoke BAPIs via the SAP Java Connector library.

:::

## Integration Steps

:::note Assumption
The following instructions assume that you have an existing CAP project that can be built successfully.
Furthermore, we assume that you deploy your app to the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment.
:::

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material

Add the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material (BOM) into the `dependencyManagement` section of the root POM.
Here is the XML snippet:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk</groupId>
            <artifactId>sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>use-latest-version-here</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

:::success Use the latest SAP Cloud SDK version

We recommend using the **latest** SAP Cloud SDK version always.
Check out the [release notes](../release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) to see the release history.

:::

:::note SAP Cloud SDK Modules Bill-of-Material

By default, the SAP Cloud SDK archetypes reference the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material `sdk-bom`, which manages dependency versions for all SAP Cloud SDK modules and transitive dependencies.
If you face dependency conflicts, you can instead try using the SAP Cloud SDK Modules Bill-of-Material `sdk-modules-bom` in the `dependencyManagement` section of your Maven POM file.

:::

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK Dependencies

Add the respective SAP Cloud SDK dependencies to the POM file under the `srv` directory.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform</groupId>
    <artifactId>scp-cf</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana</groupId>
    <artifactId>s4hana-all</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

:::note Version information controlled through the SAP Cloud SDK BOM

Note that the `version` tags can be omitted, because the previously added the SAP Cloud SDK BOM controls the version of all the SAP Cloud SDK modules.
That is, you only need to increase the version of the BOM and all modules get updated automatically.

:::

:::tip

The two mentioned dependencies are modules that cover a broad range of possible the SAP Cloud SDK use cases.
You may choose a more fine-grained selection of the SAP Cloud SDK dependencies according to your specific use case.

:::

### Add the Integration Dependency

If your app uses multitenancy features and/or a protected backend, we have to integrate the tenant and user concepts of CAP and the SAP Cloud SDK.
We'll add a respective integration dependency to the POM file under the `srv` directory (same place as the previous step).

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
  <artifactId>cds-integration-cloud-sdk</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Enable the Component Scan for SAP Cloud SDK Package

Let the Spring component scan crawl the SAP Cloud SDK package.
We'll annotate the Spring Boot application class which is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` as follows.

```java
@ComponentScan({"com.sap.cloud.sdk", "com.mycompany.myapplication"})
@ServletComponentScan({"com.sap.cloud.sdk", "com.mycompany.myapplication"})
```

Make sure that you also add the package name of your application.

### Wrap Asynchronous Calls

If your app uses asynchronous calls which spawn new threads or reuse pooled threads, the call must be decorated with the respective wrapper classes.
This decoration is required to forward thread-specific information from the calling thread to the asynchronously running thread.

You need to use the `ThreadContextExecutor` from the SAP Cloud SDK (refer to the [ThreadContext documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/multi-tenancy/multi-tenancy-thread-context/#what-is-a-thread-context)) in conjunction with the `RequestContextRunner` from [CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/provisioning-api#threading-requestcontext).

Example:

```java
final EventContext context;
final ThreadContextExecutor threadContextExecutor = new ThreadContextExecutor();
final RequestContextRunner cdsContextRunner = context.getCdsRuntime().requestContext();

final Callable<Object> task = () -> cdsContextRunner.run(context ->
                                        threadContextExecutor.execute(() -> ... ));
```

:::success Integration finished

Now the SAP Cloud SDK is integrated with the CAP application.
You can go ahead using the SAP Cloud SDK features, such as querying OData services.
