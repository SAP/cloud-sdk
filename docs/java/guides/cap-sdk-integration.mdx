This document outlines how you integrate the SAP Cloud SDK into an application based on the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) (referred to as *CAP* in the remainder).

:::success Check out the tutorial as well
While this document provides a general overview on this topic, we have published a practical [tutorial on SAP Developers](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cloudsdk-integrate-cap.html) which illustrates all steps on a comprehensive example. 
:::

## Integration Steps

:::note Assumption
The following instructions assume that you have an existing CAP project that can be built successfully.
Furthermore, we assume that you deploy your app to the SCP Cloud Foundry environment.
:::

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK BOM
Add the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material (BOM) into the `dependencyManagement` section of the root POM.
Here is the XML snippet:
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk</groupId>
            <artifactId>sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>use-latest-version-here</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>        
</dependencyManagement>
```
:::success Use latest SDK version
We recommend using the **latest** SAP Cloud SDK version always. 
Check out the [release notes](../release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) to see the release history.
:::

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK Dependencies
Add the respective Cloud SDK dependencies to the POM file under the `srv` directory.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform</groupId>
    <artifactId>scp-cf</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana</groupId>
    <artifactId>s4hana-all</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
:::note Version information controlled through Cloud SDK BOM
Note that the `version` tags can be omitted, as the Cloud SDK BOM you added beforehand controls the version of all SDK modules.
That is, you only need to increase the version of the BOM and all modules get updated automatically.
:::

### Add the Integration Dependency
In order to integrate the tenant and user concepts between CAP and the Cloud SDK, we'll add a respective integration dependency to the POM file under the `srv` directory.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
  <artifactId>cds-integration-cloud-sdk</artifactId>
</dependency> 
```

:::success Integration finished
Now the Cloud SDK is integrated into with the CAP application.
You can go ahead using the Cloud SDK features, such as querying OData services.
