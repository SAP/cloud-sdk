This document outlines how you integrate the SAP Cloud SDK into an application based on the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) (referred to as CAP in the remainder).

:::success Check out the tutorial as well
While this document provides a general overview of this topic, we have published a practical [tutorial on SAP Developers](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cloudsdk-integrate-cap.html) which illustrates all steps on a comprehensive example.
:::

## Integration Steps

:::note Assumption
The following instructions assume that you have an existing CAP project that can be built successfully.
Furthermore, we assume that you deploy your app to the SCP Cloud Foundry environment.
:::

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material

Add the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material (BOM) into the `dependencyManagement` section of the root POM.
Here is the XML snippet:

<!-- vale off -->

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk</groupId>
            <artifactId>sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>use-latest-version-here</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

<!-- vale on -->

:::success Use latest SAP Cloud SDK version
We recommend using the **latest** SAP Cloud SDK version always.
Check out the [release notes](../release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) to see the release history.
:::

### Add the SAP Cloud SDK Dependencies

Add the respective SAP Cloud SDK dependencies to the POM file under the `srv` directory.

<!-- vale off -->

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform</groupId>
    <artifactId>scp-cf</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana</groupId>
    <artifactId>s4hana-all</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

<!-- vale on -->

:::note Version information controlled through the SAP Cloud SDK BOM
Note that the `version` tags can be omitted, because the previously added the SAP Cloud SDK BOM controls the version of all SDK modules.
That is, you only need to increase the version of the BOM and all modules get updated automatically.
:::

:::tip
The two mentioned dependencies are modules that cover a broad range of possible the SAP Cloud SDK use cases.
You may choose a more fine-grained selection of the SAP Cloud SDK dependencies according to your specific use case.
:::

### Add the Integration Dependency

If your app uses multitenancy features and/or a protected backend, we have to integrate the tenant and user concepts of CAP and the SAP Cloud SDK.
We'll add a respective integration dependency to the POM file under the `srv` directory (same place as the previous step).

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
  <artifactId>cds-integration-cloud-sdk</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Enable the Component Scan for SAP Cloud SDK Package

Let the Spring component scan crawl the SAP Cloud SDK package.
We'll annotate the Spring Boot application class which is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` as follows.

```java
@ComponentScan({"com.sap.cloud.sdk", "com.mycompany.myapplication"})
@ServletComponentScan({"com.sap.cloud.sdk", "com.mycompany.myapplication"})
```

Make sure that you also add the package name of your application.

:::success Integration finished
Now the SAP Cloud SDK is integrated with the CAP application.
You can go ahead using the SAP Cloud SDK features, such as querying OData services.
