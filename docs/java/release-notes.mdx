## 3.48.0 - July 1, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.48.0)

### Known issues

- The module `usage-analytics` uses the dependency `org.jdom:jdom:2.0.6` which is affected by the vulnerability [CVE-2021-33813](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33813).
  There was no fixed dependency version available at the release date.
  We'll update this dependency once a secure version is available.  
  The dependency is used in a Maven plugin and hence there is no harm during the runtime of any BTP application.

### Compatibility Notes

- We refactored the way Java names (e.g., for classes, methods, fields, etc.) are being generated in both the OData V2 and the OData V4 VDM generator.
  This refactoring aims to grant more power over what names are to be used in the VDM to implementations of the `NamingStrategy` interface.

  Hereby, we changed the following interfaces and classes in an incompatible way:

  - The `NamingStrategy` interface has been redesigned entirely, leading to compilation errors for existing implementations.
  - The `DefaultNamingStrategy` has been renamed to `S4HanaNamingStrategy`. It stays the default value for the generator, though.
  - The `DefaultNamingStrategy.NameSource` enumeration has been moved to the package rather than being nested inside a class.

  Additionally, the entire logic, which consists of the items listed below, has been moved to the `com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel.odata.utility` package:

  - `NameSource`
  - `NamingStrategy`
  - `AbstractNamingStrategy`
  - `S4HanaNamingStrategy`

  **Users of the Maven Plugin or the CLI variant of the generators are (most likely) not affected by any incompatible changes.**

- We fixed a typo in the `com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel.odata.utility` (previously `utililty`) package name.
  The only class affected by this change is the `LegacyClassScanner`, which is meant for internal usage only.

### New Functionality

- We added the `ScpCfDestinationTokenExchangeStrategy`, which can be used to change the user token exchange behavior when retrieving destinations on BTP Cloud Foundry.

  By default, the `ScpCfDestinationLoader` always performs an initial "look up" request against the destination service.
  This is needed to get the authentication type configured in the destination, which might then require a user token exchange to authenticate at the target system.

  The newly added `ScpCfDestinationTokenExchangeStrategy` allows users to skip either the initial "look up" to increase performance, or the user token exchange:

  ```java
  // configure the ScpCfDestinationLoader to perform the user token exchange immediately
  DestinationOptions options =
    DestinationOptions
        .builder()
        .augmentBuilder(
            ScpCfDestinationOptionsAugmenter.augmenter().tokenExchangeStrategy(
                ScpCfDestinationTokenExchangeStrategy.EXCHANGE_ONLY))
        .build();

  Try<Destination> destination = DestinationAccessor.getLoader().tryGetDestination("MyDestination", options);
  ```

- The OData V4 Generator now supports parameter reordering also on bound operations (both functions and actions).
  The generator will now maintain the parameter order of a previously generated VDM, even if the parameter ordering in the EDMX changes.

### Improvements

- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update Neo JavaEE 7 SDK from `1.97.11` to `1.98.8`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Minor version updates:
      - Update Caffeine from `2.9.0` to `2.9.1`
      - Update Commons IO from `2.9.0` to `2.10.0`
      - Update Eclipse Link from `2.7.7` to `2.7.8`
      - Update Mockito from `3.10.0` to `3.11.1`
      - Update Protobuf from `3.17.1` to `3.17.3`
      - Update Bouncycastle from `1.68` to `1.69`
      - Update Wiremock from `2.28.0` to `2.28.1`

### Fixed issues

- We fixed an issue with the OData V4 VDM where bound operations on entity sets would target an incorrect URL.
- We fixed an issue in both the OData V2 and V4 VDM generators where certain OpenAPI fields on a path item led to a generator warning and caused the generation to fail if the flag `fail-on-warning` was activated.

## 3.47.0 - June 17, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.47.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/80f27f1f2f0a474896c5cc73fa84499a/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### New Functionality

- We introduced the new API `Principal#getAuthorizationsByAudience` which returns the authorizations (scopes) of the principal grouped by their audience.

### Improvements

  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update BTP Neo Tomcat 8 SDK from `3.127.13.3` to `4.1.9`
    - Update Neo JavaEE 7 SDK from `1.96.13.1` to `1.97.11`
    - Update [SAP CP Spring XSUAA Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/spring-xsuaa) from `2.8.8` to `2.8.10`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Update Protobuf Java from `3.17.0` to `3.17.1`
    - Update Netty from `4.1.64.Final` to `4.1.65.Final`
    - Update PMD from `6.34.0` to `6.35.0`
    - Update Commons IO from `2.8.0` to `2.9.0`
    - Update Gson from `2.8.6` to `2.8.7`
    - Update Mockito from `3.9.0` to `3.10.0`
    - Update jsonschema2pojo from `1.1.0` to `1.1.1`
    - Update Hibernate Core from `5.4.31.Final` to `5.4.32.Final`
    - Update Jetty from `9.4.39.v20210325` to `9.4.41.v20210516`
    - Update Spring from `5.3.4` to `5.3.5`
    - Update Spring Boot from `2.4.3` to `2.4.4`
    - Update Json Path from `2.5.0` to `2.6.0`

### Fixed issues

- We fixed an issue in the Javadoc generation for the OData V4 type-safe client (VDM), which caused the content of the `Core.Description` annotation to be ignored.
- We improved an exception message in both the OData V2 and V4 generator where an empty class name was subject to generation. This happens, for instance, if an entity type is named `Type`.

## 3.46.0 - June 3, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.46.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Compatibility Notes

- We updated the (OData V2) Trial Balance - Read (`C_TRIALBALANCE_CDS`) VDM to the [newest release 2105 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2021/05/sap-s4hana-cloud-release-2105/)

  **Caution:** The service introduced some intended **breaking changes** with the latest update which are now, in consequence, also present in the type-safe client (VDM) by the SDK.

### New Functionality

- The type-safe client (VDM) for OData V4 now gives access to bound functions and actions.
  Entities will now expose all operations bound to their type on their class.

  For example assume there is a function `IsHappy` defined for an entity `Person`, then you can use:

  ```java
  service.forEntity(person)
        .applyFunction(Person.isHappy());
  ```

  In case the function is bound to a collection use e.g.:

  ```java
  service.applyFunction(Person.AreAllHappy());
  ```

  Furthermore, if a function is marked by the service as `composable` you can also apply an operation to the result of a function directly:

  ```java
  service.forEntity(person)
        .withFunction(Person.getBestFriend())
        .navigateTo(Person.FRIENDS)
        .getAll();
  ```

  The creation of the new operation types is enabled in the OData V4 generator as well.
  Check out the full [documentation of the feature](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/use-typed-odata-v4-client-in-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java#odata-functions-and-actions) for more information.

- We updated the [OData type-safe client also known as the VDM](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/overview/) to the newest release FPS2 of SAP S/4HANA on-premise 2020. This also includes completely new services added (available as usual in packages `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.onpremise.v2020.datamodel.odata.services` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.onpremise.v2020.datamodel.odatav4.services`), new operations in previously existing services, and new entity types.

### Improvements

- We increased the default application memory setting for archetypes `scp-cf-tomee` and `scp-cf-spring` from `1024M` to `1500M`.
  This mitigates potential deployment errors due to the latest extensions in the VDM modules.

- Dependency Updates:
  - Update Fabric SDK Java from `2.2.5` to `2.2.6`
  - Update JUnit Jupiter from `5.7.1` to `5.7.2`
  - Update Netty from `4.1.63.Final` to `4.1.64.Final`
  - Update Json Sanitizer from `1.2.2` to `1.2.3`
  - Update PMD from `6.33.0` to `6.34.0`
  - Update jOOR from `0.9.13` to `0.9.14`
  - Update Java JWT from `3.15.0` to `3.16.0`
  - Update Error Prone from `2.6.0` to `2.7.1`
  - Update AMQP Client from `5.11.0` to `5.12.0`
  - Update Reactor from `3.4.5` to `3.4.6`
  - Update Wiremock from `2.27.2` to `2.28.0`
  - Update Protobuf from `3.15.8` to `3.17.0`

## 3.45.0 - May 20, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.45.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### New Functionality

- Function import calls in OData V2 using the HTTP POST method can now be embedded in batch requests.
  Within the batch request, the function import call is wrapped inside a change set since function imports can also alter business data.
  You can execute a batch request containing a function import call as follows:

  ```java
  service.batch()
    .beginChangeSet()
    .addFunctionImport(service.callSomeFunction())
    .endChangeSet()
    .executeRequest(destination);
  ```

- For the [Generic OData Client](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/generic-untyped-odata-client) filterable values and fields can now use the `in` operator in expressions.

  ```java
  StructuredQuery query;

  // Age in (40,41,42)
  query.filter(FieldReference.of("Age").in( 40,41,42 ));

  // BestFriend in Friends
  query.filter(FieldReference.of("BestFriend").in( FieldReference.of("Friends").asCollection()) );

  // 'Green' in Colors
  query.filter(ValueString.literal("Green").in( FieldReference.of("Colors").asCollection()) );
  ```

- For the [OData V4 Typed Client](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/use-typed-odata-v4-client-in-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java) filterable fields can now use the `in` operator in expressions.

  ```java
  GetAllRequestBuilder<Person> request;

  // Age in (40,41,42)
  request.filter(Person.AGE.in(40,41,42));

  // BestFriend in Friends
  query.filter(Person.TO_BEST_FRIEND.in( Person.TO_FRIENDS ) );
  ```

- Add new module `btp-business-rules` for out-of-the-box support of

  - the [SAP Business Rules Authoring](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CF_BusinessRules_Repository/resource) service,

  ```java
  // requires dependency com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:btp-business-rules
  HttpDestination authoringDestination =
    ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader
        .getDestinationForService(
            ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.CfServices.BUSINESS_RULES_AUTHORING,
            "my-business-rules");

  ProjectsApi projectsApi = new ProjectsApi(authoringDestination);
  List<ProjectVersionObject> allProjects = projectsApi.readProjects();
  ```

  - and the [SAP Business Rules Execution](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CF_BusinessRules_Runtime_V2/resource) service.

  ```java
  // requires dependency com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:btp-business-rules
  HttpDestination executionDestination =
    ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader
        .getDestinationForService(
            ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.CfServices.BUSINESS_RULES_EXECUTION,
            "my-business-rules");

  DeployUndeployRuleServiceApi deployService = new DeployUndeployRuleServiceApi(executionDestination);
  List<WorkingsetRuleServiceDefinitionResult> deployedWorkingSets = deployService.readWorkingsetRuleServices();
  ```

- We updated the [OData type-safe client also known as a VDM](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/overview/) to the [newest release 2105 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2021/05/sap-s4hana-cloud-release-2105/).
  This includes completely new services (available as usual in packages `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odatav4.services`), new operations in previously existing services, and new entity types.
  The following two services were however not updated:
  - (OData V2) Trial Balance - Read - `C_TRIALBALANCE_CDS`
  - (OData V4) Bank - `BANK_0001`

### Improvements

- Using a Swagger file to generate OData V4 entity classes will now mark entities accessible on service root path as `VdmEntitySet`.
  This enables the experimental API to [query the OData service over navigation properties directly](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/odata/use-typed-odata-v4-client-in-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java#navigation-properties).
  This feature was originally enabled for entities generated by EDMX metadata files in version [`3.20.0`](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/release-notes-sap-cloud-sdk-for-java#3200).
- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update BTP Neo Tomcat 8 SDK from `3.124.9.2` to `3.127.13.3`
    - Update Neo JavaEE 7 SDK from `1.95.7` to `1.96.13.1`
    - Update BTP CF Logging from `3.3.0` to `3.4.0`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Minor version updates:
      - Update JSON Smart from `2.4.2` to `2.4.7`
      - Update Togglz from `2.9.6` to `2.9.8`
      - Update Fabric Gateway Java from `2.2.1` to `2.2.2`
      - Update jOOQ from `3.14.8` to `3.14.9`
      - Update Hibernate Core from `5.4.39.Final` to `5.4.40.Final`

### Fixed issues

- Using `null` in OData v2 filter expressions does no longer lead to a `NullPointerException` when executing the request.
- Fix an edge case where some `BigDecimal` values where not serialized correctly in OData V2 requests.

## 3.44.1 - May 6, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.44.1) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Compatibility Notes

- The OpenAPI Generator no longer adds the prefix `src/main/java` to the output directory.
  Thus, you need to explicitly add this part to the output directory if you need it.

### New Functionality

- We enhanced the [BTP Workflow API](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_CF/overview) client library to reflect the latest state of this BTP service.
- We introduced a new CLI wrapper for the OpenAPI generator that can be used without having to set up a Maven project.

### Improvements

- Dependency Updates:
  - Minor version updates:
    - Update Reactor from `3.4.4` to `3.4.5`
    - Update Protobuf Java from `3.15.7` to `3.15.8`
    - Update PMD from `6.32.0` to `6.33.0`
    - Update JPaaS Security Utils for Neo from `1.4.89` to `1.4.90`
    - Update Jackson from `2.12.2` to `2.12.3`

### Fixed issues

- The OpenAPI Generator no longer adds the prefix `src/main/java` unexpectedly to the output directory.
- The OpenAPI Generator generates the equals method for model classes now with an argument annotated as `@Nullable`.
- We fixed an issue where the user JWT token was not sent to destinations that use the SAMLAssertion authentication method.
- For HTTP destinations with the authentication type OAuth SAML Bearer Assertion Flow the destination key store is no longer used for the TLS handshake.

## 3.43.0 - April 22, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.43.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### New Functionality

- We added a new API for creating OData v2 Changesets in Batch requests that mimics the existing OData V4 API.
  As a natural outcome, this new API also supports custom headers on a per-request basis.

  Example usage:

  ```java
  // define modification requests including custom headers per request
  MyEntityCreate createRequest = new MyEntityCreate(myNewEntityInstance).withHeader("custom-header", "value");
  MyEntityUpdate updateRequest = new MyEntityUpdate(myUpdatedEntityInstance).withHeader("another-custom-header", "another value");

  // assemble batch request by adding both modifications into a single changeset
  MyEntityBatch batchRequest = new MyEntityBatch().addChangeSet(createRequest, updateRequest);

  // execute the batch request
  BatchResponse response = batchRequest.executeRequest(myDestination);
  ```

### Improvements

- Dependency Updates:
  - Minor version updates:
    - Update Netty from `4.1.60.Final` to `4.1.63.Final`
    - Update Lombok from `1.18.18` to `1.18.20`
    - Update Jetty from `9.4.38.v20210224` to `9.4.39.v20210325`
    - Update Bouncycastle from `1.64` to `1.68`
    - Update Error Prone from `2.5.1` to `2.6.0`
    - Update Java JWT from `3.14.0` to `3.15.0`
    - Update Protobuf from `3.15.6` to `3.15.7`
    - Update Apache CXF from `3.3.8` to `3.3.10`
    - Update Mockito from `3.8.0` to `3.9.0`

## 3.42.0 - April 8, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.42.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/7d0d6f45c6b64bd3a930121641c0d65b/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### New Functionality

- We improved OData v4 update requests that use the PATCH HTTP method. Now they allow adding complex properties without the need to use setters for each value inside the complex property.
  You can use the builder pattern or the constructor to propagate the property values.

  Before:

  ```java
  Entity entity;
  ComplexProperty property = new ComplexProperty();
  property.setValue("Foo");
  entity.setComplexProperty(property);
  ```

  Now:

  ```java
  Entity entity;
  entity.setComplexProperty(new ComplexProperty("Foo"));
  ```

  Transitive changes inside a complex property will automatically be detected.

- The OData v2 generator is able to maintain argument order in function imports and get-by-key fluent helpers over successive generations, even when the originating specification changes parameter order.
  This is now a default behavior. It can be disabled by adding the flag to the plugin configuration: `<keepExistingSignatures>false</keepExistingSignatures>`
- We updated the OData v2 type-safe client (VDM) for the services that couldn't be generated because of the parameters re-ordering issue mentioned above. Now you can use them as any other service. Find the list below:
  - Purchase Requisition - API_PURCHASEREQ_PROCESS_SRV
  - Production Order Confirmation - API_PROD_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_2_SRV
  - Process Order Confirmation - API_PROC_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_2_SRV
  - Attachments - API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV

The collection of released S/4HANA Cloud client libraries from the SAP Cloud SDK is now consistent with the set of OData services that you can find in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPS4HANACloud?section=Artifacts).

### Improvements

- We enabled the OpenAPI generator to consider the vendor extension field `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name` in an OpenAPI specification on the operation, path, or on the root level.
- We enabled the OpenAPI generator to remove the suffix `api` (regardless of the case) from the extension field value of `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name`, if present.
- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update SCP Neo Java TomEE7 API from `1.93.10.2` to `1.94.8`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Minor version updates:
      - Update Reactor from `3.4.3` to `3.4.4`
      - Update Protobuf from `3.15.1` to `3.15.6`
      - Update JooQ from `3.14.7` to `3.14.8`
      - Update PMD from `6.31.0` to `6.32.0`
      - Update Hibernate Core from `5.4.28.Final` to `5.4.30.Final`
      - Update Guava from `30.1-jre` to `30.1.1-jre`
      - Update Togglz from `2.8.0` to `2.9.6`

## 3.41.0 - March 25, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.41.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/4d51cd942a184d88bd51f4385e14d7c8/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### New Functionality

- We added a convenience method to configure the proxy authorizations when building a custom `DefaultHttpDestination`.
  The `.proxyAuthorization("value")` will send `value` within the `Proxy-Authorization` header, unless that header is already set.
- The OpenAPI generator now supports the vendor extension field `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name` in an OpenAPI specification.
  By default, the OpenAPI generator uses the `tag` of an operation to determine the Java service class name.
  In case you're not happy with the name generated from the `tag` field, and changing it is not possible, you can add `x-sap-cloud-sdk-api-name` vendor extension to the `operation` section of the specification. This vendor extension will be used by the generator to derive the Java service class name.
- Enable OData requests to skip the CSRF token retrieval if the server does not require it.
  Use the method `withoutCsrfToken()` to disable the CSRF token retrieval.
- We provided experimental support for OData v2 read requests as items in a Batch request. The API is unified and similar to the OData v4 Batch request:

  ```
  BusinessPartnerService service = new DefaultBusinessPartnerService();

  BusinessPartnerFluentHelper readOperationAll = service.getAllBusinessPartner().top(10);
  BusinessPartnerByKeyFluentHelper readOperationByKey = service.getBusinessPartnerByKey("bupa9000");

  BatchResponse response = service.batch()
      .addReadOperations(readOperationAll)
      .addReadOperations(readOperationByKey)
      .executeRequest(destination);

  List<BusinessPartner> entities = response.getReadResult(readOperationAll);
  BusinessPartner entity = response.getReadResult(readOperationByKey);
  ```

### Improvements

- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update SCP Neo Java Tomcat API from `3.123.6.2` to `3.124.9.2`
    - Update SCP Neo Java TomEE7 API from `1.92.6.2` to `1.93.10.2`
    - Update [SAP CP Spring XSUAA Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/spring-xsuaa) from `2.8.4`to `2.8.7`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Minor version updates:
      - Update Spring from `5.3.3` to `5.3.4`

- The OData type-safe client (VDM) for OData V4 services of newest release [2102 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2021/02/sap-s4hana-cloud-2102-empowering-businesses-seize-opportunities/) and FPS1 of SAP S/4HANA on-premise 2020 now also supports static fields for accessible properties on `VdmComplex` types.

### Fixed issues

- We fixed an issue with OData V2 read requests where an error message was incorrectly written to the log when using filters.
  The error messages are no longer logged unless it is applicable:

  > Registered custom filter expression cannot be used when performing the OData V2 request with toRequest() or executeRequest().

  > Registered custom filter expression cannot be used when performing the OData V2 request with execute().

- Fix an issue with OData response handling where deserialization of one-to-many properties failed for primitive and complex data types.

## 3.40.0 - March 18, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.40.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Known issues

- Update requests via **PATCH** in OData V4 will not contain any changes to complex properties of an entity. This is a feature gap we plan to solve in the upcoming release.

### Compatibility Notes

- The general availability of the OpenAPI generator brings the following renamings:
  - The following dependencies in the Maven Group ID `com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel` have been renamed:
    - Rename dependency `rest-core` to `openapi-core`
    - Rename dependency `rest-generator` to `openapi-generator`
    - Rename dependency `rest-generator-maven-plugin` to `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`
  - The Maven Plugin has been renamed from `rest-generator-maven-plugin` to `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`

### New Functionality

- The OData v4 type-safe client (VDM) generator now generates static fields for accessible properties on `VdmComplex` types, which can be used exactly like their counterparts on `VdmEntity` when building OData queries.
- You can clear the cache for remote functions with the new experimental APIs `RemoteFunctionCache.clearCache(Destination)`
  and `RemoteFunctionCache.clearCache(Destination, functionName)`.
  - Example usages:
  ```java
  final Destination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination(destinationName);
  try {
    RemoteFunctionCache.clearCache(destination);
  }
  catch( final RemoteFunctionException e ) {
    //deal with exception
  }
  ```
  ```java
  final Destination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination(destinationName);
  try {
     RemoteFunctionCache.clearCache(destination, "BAPI_GET_COSTCENTER");
  }
  catch( final RemoteFunctionException e ) {
     //deal with exception
  }
  ```

### Improvements

## 3.39.0 - February 25, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.39.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Compatibility Notes

As part of the update of the pregenerated type-safe client for SAP S/4HANA On-premise, we encountered the following changes:

- The following methods of the OData v4 service `ContractAccountingBusinessPartnerPaymentService` have been renamed:

  - `getAllBusPartPaymentParameters` has been renamed to `getAllBusPartPayment`
  - `countBusPartPaymentParameters` has been renamed to `countBusPartPayment`
  - `getBusPartPaymentParametersByKey` has been renamed to `getBusPartPaymentByKey`
  - `getAllBusPartPaymentItemParameters` has been renamed to `getAllBusPartPaymentItem`
  - `countBusPartPaymentItemParameters` has been renamed to `countBusPartPaymentItem`
  - `getBusPartPaymentItemParametersByKey` has been renamed to `getBusPartPaymentItemByKey`

- The following classes of the OData v4 VDM have been renamed:

  - `ProtocolQueryReadSingle` has been renamed to `ProtocolQueryRead`
  - `StructuredPropertyCollection` has been renamed to `NavigationPropertyCollection`
  - `StructuredPropertyCollectionQuery` has been renamed to `NavigationPropertyCollectionQuery`
  - `StructuredPropertySingleQuery` has been renamed to `NavigationPropertySingleQuery`
  - `StructuredPropertySingle` has been replaced by either the `NavigationProperty<Single/Collection>Query` or the newly introduced `ComplexPropertyQuery`

- The type-safe client (VDM) classes for `TimeDependentStockLevelService` have been removed as the SAP S/4HANA on-premise OData service does not exist in releases 2020 FPS0 or FPS1.

- With SAP S/4 OnPremise release 2020 FPS1, in the type-safe client (VDM) class for `VehicleManagementSystemForVehicleService` the `getVMSVehicleIncomingInvoiceByKey` method now takes only two parameters ( `vMSVehicleUUID` and `vMSVehicleActionDateTime`) as input as opposed to three before ( `vMSVehicleUUID`,`vMSVehicleActionDateTime` and `vMSVehicleActionDocType` ).

### New Functionality

- The [type-safe OData client](features/odata/overview.mdx#type-safe-odata-client) (VDM) is updated to the latest release (FPS1) of SAP S/4HANA on-premise 2020.
  This also includes completely new services added to the pre-existing `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.onpremise.v2020.datamodel.odata.services` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.onpremise.v2020.datamodel.odatav4.services` packages.

- In the OData v2 and v4 type-safe client (VDM) generators we now support generating service methods for multiple entity sets belonging to the same entity type.
  Formerly only the first entity set of an entity type was regarded.

  ```note

  To ensure backward compatibility this feature is turned off by default.
  To activate the new functionality, supply the feature flag explicitly.

  Generator Maven Plugin Configuration:
  `<serviceMethodsPerEntitySet>true</serviceMethodsPerEntitySet>`

  Generator CLI Flag:
  `--service-methods-per-entity-set`

  ```

- The OpenAPI Generator now allows for customizing the method names on generated API classes.
  Use the vendor extension `x-sap-cloud-sdk-operation-name` to specify a name on an operation:

  ```yml
  /operation/path:
    get:
      summary: My Operation.
      x-sap-cloud-sdk-operation-name: performMyOperation
      operationId: myOperation
  ```

  This field is optional and the generator will fall back to using the `operationId` if vendor extensions are not present.

- The OpenAPI Generator now allows for setting a custom copyright header.
  Use the option `<copyrightHeader>` to set a custom header, or set the flag `<sapCopyrightHeader>` to have an SAP copyright header added.
  By default, no header is generated.

### Improvements

- The OData v2 type-safe client (VDM) classes and generator now support `null` as parameter values for function import methods when applicable.
  For visibility the respective annotations on arguments are provided, i.e. `@Nullable` and `@Nonnull`.

- The OData v4 VDM now better reflect which operations are allowed on complex properties.
  Operations that are not applicable to complex properties like `top(int)` and `skip(int)` are no longer available.
  This causes some existing classes to be renamed/removed (see Compatibility Notes)
- Dependency Updates:
  - Update JUnit Jupiter from `5.7.0` to `5.7.1`
  - Update Joda-Time from `2.10.9` to `2.10.10`
  - Update Netty from `4.1.58` to `4.1.59.Final` to overcome security vulnerability [CVE-2021-21290](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21290)
  - Update Hibernate Core from `5.4.27.Final` to `5.4.28.Final`
  - Update jOOQ from `3.4.16` to `3.4.17`
  - Update Reactor from `3.4.2` to `3.4.3`
  - Update OkHttp from `4.9.0` to `4.9.1`
  - Update Java JWT from `3.12.1` to `3.13.0`
  - Update JUnit from `4.13.1` to `4.13.2`
  - Update Caffeine from `2.8.8` to `2.9.0`

### Fixed issues

- We fixed an issue where selecting complex properties in the OData V4 VDM would lead to an incorrect HTTP query.
- We fixed an issue where very long RFC function names (>= 30 characters) would lead to an incorrect `SOAPAction` header.

## 3.38.0 - February 11, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.38.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/cfa38ab94e4f481298556d6fdaf3672b/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Compatibility Notes

- The method `getHeaders(DestinationProperties)` of extension API `DestinationHeaderProvider` is deprecated but still functional.
  Please implement `getHeaders(DestinationRequestContext)` instead.
  The new argument allows accessing the request specific `URI` as well as the original `DestinationProperties`.
- The method `ResilienceDecorator#invalidateCache` is deprecated but still functional.
  Please use `ResilienceDecorator#clearCache` for tenant aware cache invalidation or `ResilienceDecorator#clearAllCacheEntries` to clear all entries for all tenants and principals.
- As part of the update of the OData VDM to SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2102 a few operations were removed. The operations were never supported by the S/4 system (like CRUD support for some entities), so no existing functionality is affected. The following services are affected:
  - _Nota Fiscal – Create, Update_ - `API_LOGBR_NOTAFISCAL_SRV`
  - _Purchase Contracts_ - `API_PURCHASECONTRACT_PROCESS_SRV`
  - _Outbound Delivery (A2X)_ - `API_OUTBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002`

### New Functionality

- We introduced a new API on table parameters of `BapiRequest`.
  When a table uses a domain-type as row-type there are no field names to refer to.
  But such a table can be treated as a one-dimensional vector of primitive values, e.g.:

  ```java
  new BapiRequest("BAPI_DEMO", true)
    .withExportingTable("DEMO_TABLE", "BAPI_DEMO_TAB01")
      .asVector()
      .row("CC01")
      .row("CC02")
      .row("CC03")
      .end();
  ```

- We now support the `SAMLAssertion` authentication type on Cloud Foundry.
  Refer to the [help page](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/d81e1683bd434823abf3ceefc4ff157f.html) for more detail on the `SAMLAssertion` authentication type.
- We introduced a new API to build a `Destination` for connecting to services on Cloud Foundry.
  The information will be read from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable at runtime.
  For certain authentication types i.e. `NoAuthentication` and `OAuth2ClientCredentials` this API eliminates the need to manually create a destination in the CF account for connecting to services.

  Example:

  ```java
  final Map<String, String> mapping =
        ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.buildClientCredentialsMapping(
          "credentials.endpoints.service_rest_url",
          "credentials.uaa.clientid",
          "credentials.uaa.clientsecret",
          "credentials.endpoints.token_url");
  ```

  `ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.buildClientCredentialsMapping` creates a mapping for loading a destination and provides JSON paths for all required destination properties.

  ```java
  final HttpDestination destination =
        ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.getDestinationForService(
          "label",
          "serviceBindingName",
          AuthenticationType.OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS,
          mapping);
  ```

  For certain services (only workflow for now), we provide further convenience that skips the need to provide the `mapping` explicitly.
  Example:

  ```java
  final HttpDestination destination =
        ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.getDestinationForService(
          ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.CfServices.WORKFLOW,
          "my-workflow");
  ```

- We introduced a new API to construct a `ScpCfDestinationLoader` that allows overriding the default timeout for the Time Limiter resilience pattern.
  If not specified, requests will automatically timeout after 6 seconds.

- We added support for recursive tables and structures in parameters of `BapiRequest` API for both protocols: _JCo_ and _SOAP_. Example:
  ```diff
  final BapiRequest bapiReqauest = new BapiRequest("DEMO_BAPI")
      .withExportingTable("TABLE_PARAMETER1","ABC_T_PARAM1" )
      .row()
      .field("ROW_UUID","STRING","foobar")
      //Start nested table
  +   .table("TABLE_NESTED1","ABC_T_NESTED1")
  +       .row()
  +       .field("NESTED_FIELD1","STRING","john")
  +       .field("NESTED_FIELD2","STRING","doe")
  +       .end() // End nested table
       // START nested structure
       .fields("NESTED_STRUCTURE", "NESTED_STRUCTURE_TYPE")
           .field("latitude", "Axis", "52")
           .field("longitude", "Axis", "13")
           .end() // End nested structure
       .end();
  ```
- We updated the [OData type-safe client also known as a VDM](features/odata/overview.mdx) to the [newest release 2102 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2021/02/sap-s4hana-cloud-2102-empowering-businesses-seize-opportunities/). This includes completely new services (available as usual in packages `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odatav4.services`), new operations in previously existing services, and new entity types. The SDK supports all OData services listed in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPS4HANACloud) with the exception of the following services:
  - (OData V2) _Purchase Requisition_ - `API_PURCHASEREQ_PROCESS_SRV`
  - (OData V2) _Production Order Confirmation_ - `API_PROD_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_2_SRV`
  - (OData V2) _Process Order Confirmation_ - `API_PROC_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_2_SRV`
  - (OData V2) _Attachments_ - `API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV`
  - (OData V4) _Contract Accounting: Invoices of Business Partner_ - `API_CABUSPARTINVOICE_0001`

### Improvements

- `ResilienceDecorator.clearCache(ResilienceConfiguration)` does now also respect parameters defined in the `ResilienceConfiguration.CacheConfiguration` when selecting cache entries to clear.

- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update [SAP CP Spring XSUAA Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/spring-xsuaa) from `2.8.0`to `2.8.3`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Minor version updates:
      - Update Spring from `5.2.10.RELEASE` to `5.3.2`
      - Update Spring Security from `5.3.5.RELEASE` to `5.4.2`
      - Update Mockito from `3.7.0` to `3.7.7`
      - Update AssertJ from `3.18.1` to `3.19.0`
      - Update Fabric SDK for Java from `2.2.4` to `2.2.5`
      - Update Resilience4J from `1.6.1` to `1.7.0`
      - Update Java JWT Java from `3.12.0` to `3.12.1`
      - Update PMD from `6.30.0` to `6.31.0`
      - Update Lombok from `1.18.16` to `1.18.18`
      - Update Jetty from `9.4.35.v20201120` to `9.4.36.v20210114`

### Fixed Issues

- We fixed an issue with OData V4 update requests where the serialization of primitives with types like Integer, Boolean, and Double leads to null values.
- We fixed an issue with the JCo serialization of BAPI requests, where adding field parameter values of type `ErpType` led to an exception.

## 3.37.0 - January 28, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.37.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/9e7b665dbf6149ec964c148ec9bf6641/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Compatibility Notes

- We deprecated the constructor `UncheckedFilterExpression(FilterExpression)`. It can still be used for OData V2 type-safe client (VDM) read requests that are executed with the deprecated `execute(...)` method. However, we strongly encourage you to migrate to `executeRequest(...)`. Unchecked filter expressions can be instantiated with recommended constructor `UncheckedFilterExpression(ValueBoolean)`.
- We deprecated the class `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.connectivity.RequestBody` as it has no usage.
- For BTP Cloud Foundry, instances of `DestinationHeaderProvider` will be called for every HTTP request as of now. Earlier versions invoked the API only once during destination construction.

### New Functionality

- OData V2 helper class `UncheckedFilterExpression` can be instantiated for generic instances of `ValueBoolean`. Example:

  ```java
  BusinessPartnerService service;
  HttpDestination destination;

  ValueBoolean customExpression = FieldReference.of("ShoeSize").equalTo(42);

  List<BusinessPartner> items = service
      .getAllBusinessPartner()
      .filter( new UncheckedFilterExpression<>(customExpression) )
      .executeRequest(destination);
  ```

- The `DefaultHttpDestination` now allows for registering a `DestinationHeaderProvider` to enrich outgoing HTTP requests with headers.
  It can be used as follows:
  ```java
   DefaultHttpDestination
          .builder(uri)
          .headerProviders(new CustomHeaderProvider(), new AnotherCustomHeaderProvider())
          .build();
  ```

### Improvements

- OData requests are now allowed to contain null values within entity keys and function parameters as per the [OData specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html#sec_null).
  Previously an exception would be thrown in these cases.
- Removed Swagger annotations `ApiModel` and `ApiModelProperty` from classes generated by the [OpenAPI client generator](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/rest/generate-rest-client)
  - Swagger annotations dependency (`io.swagger.swagger-annotations`) can now safely be removed from the project's `pom.xml`
- The Workflow API client library in module `scp-workflow-cf` got enhanced to reflect the latest Workflow API features.
- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update SCP CF Java Logging Support from `3.2.1` to `3.3.0`

## 3.36.0 - January 14, 2021

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.36.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/aa4a7715649349a285a13c8bc1d585d8/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Compatibility Notes

- We removed the following dependencies from the SAP Cloud SDK Bill-of-Material (BOM):
  - Netty
  - Protobuf
  - Spring Security OAuth
  - Hibernate Validator

### New Functionality

- We introduced support for the String-based filter functions `endsWith`, `startsWith` and `substringOf` in the OData V2 type-safe client (VDM).
- Check out our new [Feature Matrix](../overview/feature-matrix.mdx). We're actively extending it. Let's us know what you'd like to see there by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md&title=).

### Improvements

- We replaced the deprecated constant `org.apache.commons.codec.Charsets.UTF_8` in the HelloWorldControllerTest class of the Spring archetype by its recommended successor `java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8`.
  This resolves a compiler warning.
- We added Maven module `s4hana-api-odata-v4` into `s4hana-all` to enable type-safe OData v4 client library (VDM) for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Edition.
- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Major version updates:

      - Update Netty BOM from `4.1.49.Final` to `4.1.56.Final`
      - Update Java JWT from `3.11.0` to `3.12.0`

### Fixed issues

- We fixed incorrect serialization of `date` values for OData V2 requests using the `PATCH` request method.
- We fixed an issue where OData Batch requests were sending an invalid `Accept` header.
- We fixed an issue where the API for OData Batch responses did not conveniently throw or wrap an exception for failing HTTP response code health checks.
  Affected methods:
  - OData v4 VDM: `getReadResult` of `BatchResult`
  - OData v2 VDM: `get` of `BatchResponse`
  - OData Client: `getResult` of `ODataRequestResultMultipartGeneric`
- We removed a log message that incorrectly indicated an error when receiving an OData response without payload.

## 3.35.0 - December 17, 2020

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.35.0) | [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/55bb1642ea614bf582d514ed34401136/1.0/en-US/index.html)

### Known issues

- OData Batch response API is known to not conveniently throw or wrap an exception for failing HTTP response code health checks.
  This affects the type-safe batch request builders for both v2 and v4 protocol. We're working to fix this in the next release.

### Compatibility Notes

- We removed a dependency reference for JUnit Pioneer. The last used version was `1.0.0`

      - Update Jetty from `9.4.34.v20201102` to `9.4.35.v20201120`

### Fixed issues

- We fixed an issue where OData errors originating in OData batch change sets requests could not be parsed correctly.

## 3.34.1 - December 9, 2020

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.34.1)

### Compatibility Notes

- To use the experimental version of OpenAPI type-safe client generator you longer need to add the `org.springframework:spring-context` dependency in a project.
- Requests to fetch `CSRF` token that are done for OData v2 function imports now contain all explicitly specified HTTP headers. Before they contained only implicitly set HTTP headers and neglect headers provided via `.withHeaders()` method of `RequestBuilder` class.

### New Functionality

- We improved `@ODataResponseException` to contain an HTTP status code returned from the server to improve debugging experience.
- Caught instances of `ODataResponseException` allow accessing `@Nonnull Option<String> getHttpBody` to simplify investigation while debugging and at runtime.
- OData function imports now allow accessing the built-in OData request object via the `toRequest` method.

### Improvements

- Add support for alternative OData v4 metadata field notations `@type`, `@context`, and other introduced with OData Version `4.0.1`. The SDK is now able to parse this notation. However, outgoing requests will always use the notation that is compatible with Version `4.0.0` of the standard for now to ensure server compatibility.
- The Workflow API client library in module `scp-workflow-cf` was enhanced with the latest Workflow API features.
- The CSRF token retrieval of OData v2 type-safe function imports has been improved:

  - Function imports using the HTTP method GET no longer issue the unnecessary CSRF token request
  - Function imports using the HTTP method POST can be processed even if the CSRF token retrieval fails (for example, if the server does not support CSRF tokens)

- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Downgrade SAP security related libraries from `2.7.8` to `2.7.6`

### Fixed issues

- `ClassCastException` fix an issue with accessing navigational properties directly in OData V4 requests. Read and count operations performed on nested collections directly via e.g. `service.naviagteTo(Entity.COLLECTION_PROPERTY).getAll()` would cause a `ClassCastException` when parsing the result. This is now done correctly.
- Fix an issue where dependency conflicts between the SDK and the SAP Java Buildback lead to runtime issues on the SCP Cloud Foundry.
- Fix an issue where operations with empty payload in OData Batch request changesets on SAP S/4HANA OData services failed with _Bad Request_ responses.

## 3.34.0 - December 3, 2020

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.34.0)

### Compatibility Notes

- The Maven artifact `rest-core moved` from the group id `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services` to `com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel`.
- We introduced new implementations of `ThreadContextListener` and `ThreadContextDecorator`. We adapted the internal priority of listeners and decorators accordingly.
- Archetypes generated by the Cloud SDK for Java were migrated to the [general purpose pipeline of project "Piper"](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/stages/introduction/). Before they were using the [SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery pipeline](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) that is now deprecated. For existing projects we also recommend [migrating](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/blob/master/gpp-guide.md) migrating to this pipeline.

### New Functionality

- We released experimental type-safe client generator for OpenAPI 3.0 specification and `maven` [plugin](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/rest/generate-rest-client) to run it. We do not yet recommend using it in production.

---

- We released experimental support for OData server-driven paging
  - The read request builders for OData v2 and v4 have a new feature that enables lazy iteration through result-set pages.
  - You can use memory-efficient or latency-reduced data processing depending on your use-case.

Example:

```java
// Let's assume these are your requests for OData v2 and v4 to fetch entities.
FluentHelperRead<?, EntityT, ?> request = service.getEntities(); // for v2
GetAllRequestBuilder<EntityT> request = service.getEntities(); // for v4

// Before you had only this method which would fetch all the data eagerly by
// travesing through pages and providing the final result set for you.
List<EntityT> defaultEager = request.execute( destination );

// Now you have an option to handle paginated results yourself using one of the
// methods below depending on your use-case.
Iterable<EntityT> lazyIterable = request.iteratingEntities().execute( destination );
Stream<EntityT> lazyStream = request.streamingEntities().execute( destination );
Iterable<List<EntityT>> lazyPages = request.iteratingPages().execute( destination );
```

:::note

- For OData v2 the execute method is called `executeRequest`
- The default behavior for OData v2 and v4 is now to return accumulated results from all pages. Before only the first page of results was returned.

:::

### Fixed Issues

- RFC calls executed via the resilience decorator now use subscriber tenant instead of provider tenant which is correct behavior for multi-tenant applications.
- non-Latin characters in the quNonery and path part of OData URLs are now correctly encoded.

## 3.33.0 - November 20, 2020

[Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/index.html) | [Release blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1225215) | [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.33.0)

### Compatibility Notes

- The client library for SAP S/4HANA Enterprise Messaging is deprecated. This affects all classes in the following modules: [`s4hana-api-messaging`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana/s4hana-api-messaging), [`messaging-core`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel/messaging-core), [`messaging-jms`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel/messaging-jms)

- _Blockchain Business Services Visibility_: The members of the class [`MerkleProof`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/services/blockchainbusinessservices/blockchainvisibility/MerkleProof.html) are now immutable, forbidding any external modification of a proof

### New Functionality

- Destinations can be conveniently added into the [`DestinationAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationAccessor.html) logic at runtime. It exposes two new methods [`appendDestinationLoader()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationAccessor.html#appendDestinationLoader-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationLoader-) and [`prependDestinationLoader()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationAccessor.html#prependDestinationLoader-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationLoader-) which add destination loaders with high or low priority to the accessor logic. Leverage a new default implementation for the [`DestinationLoader`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationLoader.html) interface to load destinations created at runtime:

  ```java
  DestinationLoader loader = new DefaultDestinationLoader().registerDestination(myHttpDestination);
  DestinationAccessor.appendDestinationLoader(loader);
  ```

  This new API is experimental.

### Improvements

- The SCP Workflow API client library in module [`scp-workflow-cf`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.services/scp-workflow-cf) is now generally available and released for productive usage.
- All OData V2 and V4 request builder classes now expose an experimental method [`toRequest()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odatav4/core/RequestBuilder.html#toRequest--) that returns a low-level, generic request object. It provides more convenience for debugging and flexibility to work around a non-standard service behavior.
- The method [`withHeader()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odatav4/core/RequestBuilder.html#withHeader-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-) of OData V4 request builders is no longer experimental.

- Improve the class hierarchy of [`ODataException`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f8a1835a26b848f69536b34bf46eeb93/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/client/exception/ODataException.html):

  - Declare all subclasses as stable API

## 3.32.0 - November 5, 2020

[Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/f08906c8d31640d583a106325f6a8184/1.0/en-US/index.html) | [Release blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1217367) | [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.32.0)

### Compatibility Notes

- OData requests do no longer send the query parameter `$format=json` by default. Instead the `Accept` header is set to `application/json` by default.

The following changes apply to experimental functionality of the SAP Cloud SDK:

- The SCP service "Hyperledger Fabric on SAP Cloud Platform" is deprecated, the corresponding Maven dependency `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:scp-blockchain` gets deprecated too. Use the dependency [`com.sap.cloud.sdk.serices:blockchain-client-fabric`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.services/blockchain-client-fabric) instead.
- The method `setResponseFormat()` in the class [`ODataRequestGeneric`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f08906c8d31640d583a106325f6a8184/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/client/request/ODataRequestGeneric.html) is no longer available. You can still configure the `Accept` header via the method [`addHeaderIfAbsent()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/f08906c8d31640d583a106325f6a8184/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/client/request/ODataRequestGeneric.html#addHeaderIfAbsent-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-).
  Example: `request.addHeaderIfAbsent(HttpHeaders.ACCEPT, "application/xml")`.
- The enum `com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel.odata.client.request.ODataFormat` is no longer public.

### New Functionality

- Update the OData client library to the [newest release 2011 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2020/10/sap-s4hana-cloud-release-2011-customer-driven-innovation/). This includes completely new services (available as usual in packages [com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services](https://help.sap.com/doc/f08906c8d31640d583a106325f6a8184/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/odata/services/package-summary.html) and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odatav4.services`), new operations in previously existing services, and new entity types. The SDK supports all OData services listed in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPS4HANACloud).
- Released new pregenerated type-safe client libraries for the OData v4 services in the [latest RTC release 2020 of SAP S/4HANA On-premise](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/07/sap-s-4hana-2020-release/)
- The untyped, generic OData client and OData V4 client now support `Edm.Binary` as value type for Entity properties. In Java, this type is conveniently represented as `byte[]`. The OData V4 generator will now generate affected services without raising a warning. Generated entities that have binary properties now have static accessors to the respective fields, similar to the other entity properties. OData filter expressions for binary properties can be created.
- Add generated service `DocumentComplianceElectronicDocumentFileService` for API [`ELECTRONICDOCFILE_0001`](https://api.sap.com/api/ELECTRONICDOCFILE_0001)

### Improvements

- OData requests contain the `Accept` header with value `application/json` by default.
- Dependency Updates:
  - [SAP Cloud Security Client](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration) from `2.7.7` to `2.7.8`
  - [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html) from version `1.40.6` to `1.40.11`

  - Lombok from `1.18.14` to `1.18.16`
  - Caffeine from `2.8.5` to `2.8.6`
  - Resilience4j from `1.6.0` to `1.6.1`
  - Mockito from `3.5.13` to `3.5.15`
  - Fabric SDK for Java from `2.2.1` to `2.2.2`
  - Netty from `4.1.52.Final` to `4.1.53.Final`

## 3.31.0 - October 22, 2020

[Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/b45585e40ebc4e4b975ab6953227fc00/1.0/en-US/index.html) | [Release blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1207517) | [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.31.0)

### New Functionality

- Generated OData V4 client library service types provide a new method `batch()` to conveniently create instances of `BatchRequestBuilder`. It can be used to combine multiple reading and modifying OData operations into one OData Batch request.
- We released new pregenerated type-safe client libraries (also known as the Virtual Data Model - VDM) for the [latest RTC release 2020 of SAP S/4HANA On-premise](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/07/sap-s-4hana-2020-release/). Except for the following services, everything else available in [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA On-Premise 2020](https://api.sap.com/package/S4HANAOPAPI?section=Artifacts) are available:
  - [Settlement Document](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_SETTLMT_DOC_0001/resource)
  - [Settlement Process Type - Read](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_SETTLMT_PROC_TYPE_0001/resource)
  - [Responsibility Management Team Configurations - Read](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_RESPYM_TEAM_CONFIG_SRV_0001/resource)
  - [Real Estate Contract (Synchronous A2X)](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_RECONTRACT_0001/resource)
  - [Settlement Document Type - Read](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_SETTLMT_DOC_TYPE_0001/resource)
  - [Responsibility Management Teams - Read](https://api.sap.com/api/OP_API_RESPYM_TEAM_SRV_0001/resource)

### Improvements

- The Workflow API client library in module `scp-workflow-cf` got enhanced to reflect the latest Workflow API features.
- Update Dependencies
  - Spring dependency for the SAP Cloud Platform multitenancy implementation module to version `4.3.29.RELEASE` to overcome the security vulnerability [CVE-2020-5421](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5421).
  - Apache HttpComponents from version `4.5.12` to `4.5.13`
  - Jackson from `2.11.2` to `2.11.3`
  - Java JWT from `3.10.3` to `3.11.0`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where responses of OData batch requests could not be evaluated if the batch request contained semantically identical request objects (e.g. creating two similar entities).
- Fix an issue where an OData VDM generated with the OData V4 generator would not compile when a complex type contained a list of properties.
- Fix an issue where error responses of OData V2 requests could not be parsed correctly.

## 3.30.0 - October 8, 2020

[Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/0a2f2acc08ef4bf4a21c1e346f249afe/1.0/en-US/index.html) | [Release blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1207517) | [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.30.0)

### Compatibility Notes

To unify OData V2 client to OData V4 client APIs, the API of custom header configuration has been simplified and partially deprecated on OData V2 side:

```java
    requestV2
        .withHeader("Authorization", "Basic user:secret")
        .onRequestAndImplicitRequests() // deprecated
        .withHeader("User-Agent", "Robot")
        .onRequestOnly() // deprecated
        .execute(httpDestination);

    // ... still works, but should be migrated to:

    requestV2
        .withHeader("Authorization", "Basic user:secret")
        .withHeader("User-Agent", "Robot")
        .executeRequest(httpDestination);
```

The deprecated code ist still usable. No breaking changes in code or behavior are introduced.

The internal fluent helper class `FluentHelperCustomHttpHeader` is changed to a deprecated interface. The related methods `getHeadersForRequestAndImplicitRequests` and `getHeadersForRequestOnly` are deprecated. The former modifier will be used by default in the future. Please use the existing `withHeader` and `withHeaders` methods without the stating a deprecated modifier.

The internal protected methods `getHeadersForRequestOnly` and `getHeadersForRequestAndImplicitRequests` from abstract base class `FluentHelperBasic` are deprecated. Please use protected `getHeaders()` instead.

The internal interface `CsrfTokenRetriever` defines another `retrieveCsrfToken` method with additional `headers` parameter to be passed in the HTTP request.

### New Functionality

Blockchain Business Services update:

- It is now possible to send, receive, and validate notarizations. Sending a document will automatically also send its notarizations if the visibility configuration is set to include notarizations.

### Improvements

- In case a `DefaultErpHttpDestination` decorates an on-premise `HttpDestination` and the destination configuration
  lacks a `sap-client` property, an information message is logged to raise awareness for potential authentication issues.
- Dependency Updates:
  - Update Spring Boot from `2.3.3.RELEASE` to `2.3.4.RELEASE`
  - Update JUnit Jupiter from `5.6.2` to `5.7.0`
  - Update Spring from `5.2.8.RELEASE` to `5.2.9.RELEASE`
  - Update Spring Security from `5.3.4.RELEASE` to `5.4.0`
  - Update Mockito from `3.5.10` to `3.5.11`
- Maven Plugin Updates in Archetypes:
  - Update Maven Surefire Plugin from `3.0.0-M4` to `3.0.0-M5`
  - Update Maven Jacoco Plugin from `0.8.5` to `0.8.6`

## 3.29.1 - September 24, 2020

[Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/19a252e3d0314162a6faac1dad67a102/1.0/en-US/index.html) | [Release blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/09/25/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.29.1-for-java-and-1.28.2-for-javascript/) | [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.29.1)

### Compatibility Notes

- To leverage the new **OData v2 client**, you need to adjust existing code. Refer to [documentation on how to switch](features/odata/type-safe-client-odata-v2.mdx#switch-to-improved-odata-v2-type-safe-client) for detailed instructions.
- We start deprecating APIs of the outdated **OData v2 client**. In this release we deprecated:
  - Methods: `execute`, `toQuery`, `withErrorHandler`, `cachingMetadata`, `withoutCachingMetadata`, `ignoringVersionIdentifier` and `ignoreVersionIdentifier`.
  - Error handler: `ODataVdmErrorResultHandler`.
  - Exception classes `VersionIdentifierMissingException` and `VersionIdentifierExpiredException`.
  - You'll find instructions how to adjust the code to use the new **OData v2 client** in the Javadoc of deprecated method or class.

### New Functionality

- The improved OData v2 type-safe client is now Generally Available. From now on we recommend it for OData API consumption.
  Refer to the [documentation on how to switch](features/odata/type-safe-client-odata-v2.mdx#switch-to-improved-odata-v2-type-safe-client) for more details on the new OData 2 client.

  - The methods `executeRequest` are no longer marked as Beta and ready for use in production code.
  - The new methods `matchAnyVersionIdentifier()` and `disableVersionIdentifier()` allow for better control over [ETag handling](features/odata/type-safe-client-odata-v2.mdx#handling-of-etags).

- The `DefaultHttpDestination` and `DefaulErptHttpDestination` can use a `java.security.KeyStore` and a key store password for HTTP communication. This is especially useful when utilizing mutual TLS (mTLS) for the communication with a remote system. Use the respective builder methods to set these values as in the following code snippet:

```java
final DefaultHttpDestination defaultHttpDestination =
            DefaultHttpDestination.builder(uri).
            keyStore(keyStore).
            keyStorePassword(keyStorePassword).
            build();
```

- We updated the Workflow API client library that is shipped as `scp-workflow-cf` module. It now supports the latest Workflow API service features.

### Improvements

- Handle requesting a CSRF token for **OData V4** batch operations and actions
- Improve the log output and error handling of CSRF token requests
- In case a `DefaultErpHttpDestination` decorates an on-premise `HttpDestination` and the destination configuration lacks an `sap-client` property, a notification appears in app logs to raise awareness of potential authentication issues.
- `Update` and `Delete` requests in **OData v4** type-safe client no longer send a `*` in the `IF_MATCH` header if no version identifier (ETag) has been retrieved from the server previously. This ensures consistent behavior of `Update` and `Delete` requests and protects you from unintended data loss and integrity problems.

- Dependency Updates:
  - Update [SAP Cloud Security Client](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration) from `2.7.6` to `2.7.7`
  - Upgrade Fabric SDK for Java from `2.1.0` to `2.2.1`
  - Upgrade Fabric Gateway for Java from `2.1.0` to `2.2.0`
  - Upgrade Commons Codec from `1.14` to `1.15`
  - Upgrade Commons IO from `2.7.0` to `2.8.0`
  - Upgrade AssertJ from `3.17.0` to `3.17.2`
  - Upgrade Mockito from `3.5.7` to `3.5.10`
  - Upgrade Wiremock from `2.27.1` to `2.27.2`
  - Upgrade Netty from `4.1.51.Final` to `4.1.52.Final`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where invalid service metadata files would cause the `odata-generator` to fail. The generator now skips such services with a warning and only fails if the `failOnWarning` flag is set.
- Fix special characters escaping and double encoding issues. The following characters are encoded now:
  - `%`, `#` ,`' '`, `?` , `\` and `"` in the service and entity path
  - `%`, `#` ,`' '`, `?` , `\` , `"` , `$` and `&` in system query options
  - `%`, `#` ,`' '`, `?` , `\` , `"` , `$` , `&` and `/` in string parameters being passed in functions and GetByKey requests

## 3.28.1 - September 10, 2020

[Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/4c43c34d44aa4b839b8fa3d7aac74d70/1.0/en-US/index.html) | [Release blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1178236) | [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:3.28.1)

### Compatibility Notes

- Blockchain Business Services: The constructors of classes `Me` and `Partner` are no longer public. New instances can be constructed using a builder, by calling `Me.builder()` and `Partner.builder()` respectively.
- Blockchain Business Services: `IdentityClient.deletePartner` now only requires the `Partner`'s ID instead of a full object.

### New Functionality

- The [Currency Conversion](extensions/sap-currency-conversion-extension-library-for-cloud-sdk-for-java) library has been added. You can use this library to facilitate currency exchange rate conversions within your Cloud application.
  - Note that no exchange rates are provided by the library. It is assumed that you have your own data providers for getting the exchange rates.
  - The library supports bulk conversions, direct one-to-one conversions from a source value to a target value, and indirect conversions based on inverse rates or a reference currency.
  - You can perform currency conversions based on a fixed currency exchange rate, or a non-fixed rate (if you want the library to select the most appropriate rate based on a list of data from various data providers).
  - To use the library, add the `currency-conversion-core` and `currency-conversion-datamodel` Maven dependencies in your pom.xml.

### Improvements

- Update dependencies:
  - Update [SAP Cloud Security Client](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration) from `2.7.5` to `2.7.6`
  - Update AssertJ Core from `3.16.1` to `3.17.0`

- Fix an `org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException` with a nested `java.lang.NoSuchMethodException` when adding the Maven dependency `scp-workflow-cf` to a Spring Boot project

## 3.27.0 - August 27, 2020

- [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/5271979a09384c8aaf7a8a4cde53fc7d/1.0/en-US/index.html)
- [Release Blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1172769)

### New functionality

- The implicit properties of `DefaultHttpClientFactory` can now be customized.
  - With `HttpClientAccessor.setHttpClientFactory( HttpClientFactory )` it is possible to change the logic that manages creation and configuration of `HttpClient` instances. These clients are used to handle the connection between platform services and integration endpoints internally. The `DefaultHttpClientFactory` class has been updated to allow for conveniently changing properties like time-out duration and maximum number of connections. Since the implementation can easily be extended, a custom logic would not need to start from scratch.
  - To change the properties, either create a new class that inherits from `DefaultHttpClientFactory` and override the accessor methods with scope protected. Or explore the flexible builder pattern for a similar result: `DefaultHttpClientFactory.builder()`.
  - For more information, please find [the related documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-http-client).

### Improvements

- Improve log message quality of OData V2 errors that may occur within `executeRequest` method.
- Update dependencies in maven archetypes:
  - Archetype `scp-cf-tomee`:
    - Update `tomee-maven-plugin` from `8.0.3` to `8.0.4`
  - Archetype `scp-cf-spring`:
    - Update `spring-boot` from `2.3.0.RELEASE` to `2.3.2.RELEASE`
  - Archetype `scp-neo-javaee7`:
    - Update `scp.sdkVersion` from `1.74.10` to `1.79.14`

## 3.26.0 - August 13, 2020

- [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/170aace62830463d8f4ec9a9251667ee/1.0/en-US/index.html)
- [Release Blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1164213)

### New functionality

#### OData and type-safe client libraries

- **We released a Beta version of improved type-safe client library implementation for OData v2 protocol which now shares a code base with OData v4 protocol.** It brings significant advantages like:
  - Boosting performance by avoiding unnecessary metadata calls
  - The same code base for both OData protocol versions speeds up the innovation cycle and unlocks the developing of advanced features for both OData versions.
  - For more insights and guide how to switch to an new version check our [type-safe client documentation](features/odata/use-typed-odata-v2-and-v4-client-for-java#switch-to-improved-odata-vdm-beta)

---

- The results of `create` and `update` operations in OData v4 type-safe client now offer `getModifiedEntity()` method which returns a new `Entity object` including any changes to payload or metadata the service may have responded with.

---

- **We released a regular update for pregenerated type-safe client libraries (also known as VDM) for the [latest RTC release 2008 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2020/08/sap-s4hana-cloud-release-2008-stay-ahead-change/).**
  - The update covers all the changes to existing services and introduces new ones. You'll find them in `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odatav4.services`. Below is the quick reference on difference and compatibility between 2005 and current 2008 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud releases:
  - These deprecated OData **services are no longer allowed**:
    - Removed deprecated `ChangeMasterService`, use the successor "[ChangeMasterServiceV2Service](https://api.sap.com/api/API_CHANGEMASTER_0002/resource)" instead.
    - Removed deprecated `ProcessOrderConfirmationService`, use the successor "[ProcessOrderConfirmationV2Service](https://api.sap.com/api/API_PROC_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_2_SRV/resource)" instead.
    - Removed deprecated `ProductionOrderConfirmationService`, use the successor "[ProductionOrderConfirmationV2Service](https://api.sap.com/api/API_PROD_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_2_SRV/resource)" instead.
  - These OData service **methods have a changed argument order**:
    - In service `SalesDocumentWithCreditBlocksService` the methods `rejectCreditBlock` and `releaseCreditBlock` are updated.
    - In service `CustomerReturnsDeliveryV2Service` the methods `setPutawayQuantityWithBaseQuantity`, `putawayOneItemWithBaseQuantity` and `putawayOneItemWithSalesQuantity` are updated.
  - These OData service **methods have been removed**:
    - In service `ProductionOrderConfirmationV2Service` the method `createProdnOrdConfMatlDocItm` has been removed.
    - In service `ProcessOrderConfirmationV2Service` the method `createProcOrdConfMatlDocItm` has been removed.
    - In service `SupplierInvoiceIntegrationService` the methods `createSuplrInvcItemAcctAssgmt` and `createSuplrInvcItemPurOrdRef` have been removed.
  - For reference on what OData services are included in current release, check out [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPS4HANACloud)

#### REST

- The experimental REST SCP Workflow client library got enhanced with a new API class constructor that expects an `ApiClient`, which allows for easier integration with e.g., the Spring `RestTemplate`.

  ```java
  final String basePath = "https://my-api.org";
  final RestTemplate restTemplate  = obtainRestTemplate();

  final ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(restTemplate).setBasePath(basePath);

  new WorkflowDefinitionsApi(apiClient).queryDefinitions();
  ```

#### SAP Cloud Platform - Clound Foundry

- We added support for new authentication types recently introduced on SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry. It further improves handling of `Destinations` and keeps SDK up to date with SCP features:
  - `SAP_ASSERTION_SSO`
  - `OAuth2JWTBearer`
  - `OAuth2Password`

### Known issues

- The module `testutil-core` references the dependency `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server:jar:9.4.27.v20200227` transitively which is subject to vulnerability [CVE-2019-17638](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564984). As we look into updating to the newest version of `jetty-server`, one can mitigate the risk by assuming that `testutil-core` is used for testing only and hence not used in production environments.

### Compatibility notes

- Client library for `ELECTRONICDOCFILE_0001` service is missing from SAP S/4HANA 2008 release. We're working to fix this as fast as possible and will communicate it in release notes.

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where calling a remote-enabled function module that returns a table of type raw (byte sequence) returned the hash code of the byte sequence. It returns the String representation of the byte sequence instead now.
- Fix a `NullPointerException` when invoking a function module in SAP S/4HANA which is not remote-enabled or does not exist.
- Fix an issue where calling a remote-enabled function module with a byte sequence as an exporting parameter was not supported before. It is now possible to pass byte sequences as exporting parameters.

## 3.25.0 - July 30, 2020

- [Javadoc](https://help.sap.com/doc/6bb07895fec64c22846d8f8c6169611c/1.0/en-US/index.html)
- [Release Blog](https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1154386)

### New Functionality

- OData 4.0: Extract version identifiers from the `ETag` header in case of create and update operations. Now result entities obtained via `ModificationRespnse#getResponseEntity()` will contain a version identifier. It will be sent as `IF-MATCH` header in subsequent update and delete operations.

- New experimental method `ScpCfDestinationLoader#tryGetDestination`.
  It allows for custom request handling to resources on _SAP Cloud Platform Destination Service_.
  With the handler acting as functional interface, you can conveniently manage your own HTTP interaction. E.g.

  ```java
  String destinationName;
  String basePath;
  String relativePath;

  Try<ScpCfDestination> destination = new ScpCfDestinationLoader()
    .tryGetDestination(
      destinationName, basePath, relativePath,
      (uri) -> restTemplate.getForObject(uri, ScpCfDestinationServiceV1Response.class));
  ```

### Improvements

- Update dependencies:
  - Update [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html) from version `1.40.2` to `1.40.6`
  - Update [SAP Cloud Security Client](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration) from `2.7.3` to `2.7.5`
- Update Maven plugins in Maven archetypes:
  - Archetype `scp-cf-tomee`:
    - Update `tomee-maven-plugin` from `8.0.1` to `8.0.3`
  - Archetype `scp-cf-tomee` and `neo-javaee7`:
    - Update `maven-war-plugin` from `3.2.3` to `3.3.1`
- Add public enum `SoapNamespace` to `rfc` module, with experimental support to customize expected XML tag namespace from SOAP response messages. This can be useful if target SOAP service is not working with ABAP code.
- The principal id can be extracted from authorization tokens of grant type `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`.

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue on SCP Neo with anonymous HTTP requests being blocked, when optional module `concurrency-scp-neo` was added as application dependency.
- Fix an issue with SOAP wrapped RFC and BAPI calls that sends pure exporting parameters as empty tags in SOAP serialised requests. Exporting parameters are no longer sent in SOAP serialised requests.
- Fix an issue with SOAP wrapped RFC and BAPI calls where de-serialisation failed when the exporting parameter is a list and is empty.
- Fixed an issue with listeners where `FileWritingODataQueryListener` was inadvertently called for OData CRUD operations.

- Fix an issue on SCP Neo with tenant-aware execution of a [`Callable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/concurrent/Callable.html) when using [`TenantAccessor.executeWithTenant()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e95b7f89bb45412b943760333df7a016/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/tenant/TenantAccessor.html#executeWithTenant-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.tenant.Tenant-java.util.concurrent.Callable-) in conjunction with a `DefaultTenant`

## 3.22.0

- Release date: June 18, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/09e785cb1f214f36be539d2059cc2cb1/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1126097

### Compatibility Notes

- Deprecated the constructor `SoapRequest(Class<ServiceT>, Destination)` in favor of `SoapRequest(Class<ServiceT>, HttpDestination)` because SOAP API invocation always uses the HTTP protocol.

### New Functionality

- A new, experimental API to run generic OData batch requests via `ODataRequestBatch` in version agnostic module `odata-client`.
  It allows for batching entity read and modification requests. Modifications are grouped within changesets and, depending on the service implementation, they are expected to rollback if one change in the set was unsuccessful. Multiple changesets and read requests can be attached.
  The class supports entity request handling for _create_, _read_, _update_ and _delete_, as well as service specific _functions_ and _actions_.

  - Notes

    - The API is not considered final yet. The class is `@Beta` annotated. Please refrain from using it in productive application code.
    - There are no helper methods on the result object yet to conveniently parse the multipart response. However the `HttpResponse` object can be accessed already.
    - The order of method invocations matters. It defines how the individual requests are serialized, when constructing the multipart batch request.
    - Sample code:

      ```
      HttpClient httpClient;
      ODataRequestRead read1;
      ODataRequestCreate create2;
      ODataRequestUpdate update3;

      ODataRequestBatch batchRequest =
        new ODataRequestBatch( "service-path/", ODataProtocol.V4 )
          .addRead( read1 )
          .beginChangeset()
          .addCreate( create2 )
          .addUpdate( update3 )
          .endChangeset();

      batchRequest.execute( httpClient );
      ```

- Add `getAllDestinations(DestinationOptions options)` in `ScpCfDestinationLoader` class to fetch all the cloud foundry destinations. The method prioritizes the destination at service instance level in case there exists a destination with the same name on service instance and on sub account level.

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where subscriber tenant and principal information would not be available in asynchronous threads when running on SAP Cloud Platform Neo.

## 3.21.0

- Release date: June 4, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/b41a577bf05c42fdabcaab04e31b3e5c/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1115317

### New Functionality

- Enhance the interface `CloudPlatform` with the method `setEnvironmentVariableReader(Function<String, String>)` allowing adjusting the way how environment variables are read.
- Add experimental filter expressions in OData client value types of package `com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel.odata.client.expression` to allow for custom requests having entity-independent, yet type-safe query filters.

### Improvements

- Update dependencies:
  - Update Java JWT from `3.10.2` to `3.10.3`
  - Update Junit Pioneer from `0.5.6` to `0.6.0`
  - Update AssertJ from `3.15.0` to `3.16.1`
  - Update Spring from `5.2.5.RELEASE` to `5.2.6.RELEASE`
  - Update Spring Security from `5.3.1.RELEASE` to `5.3.2.RELEASE`
  - Update Hibernate Validator from `6.1.2.Final` to `6.1.5.Final`
  - Update Netty BOM from `4.1.49.Final` to `4.1.50.Final`
  - Update Stax2 api from `4.2`to `4.2.1`
  - Update Protocol Buffers Java from `3.11.4` to`3.12.1`
- Update dependencies in maven archetypes:
  - Archetype `scp-cf-spring`:
    - Update `spring-boot` from `2.2.6.RELEASE` to `2.3.0.RELEASE`
  - Archetype `scp-neo-javaee7`:
    - Update `scp.sdkVersion` from `1.72.13` to `1.74.10`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue in the realm of HTTP destinations created through the SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory where a `DestinationAccessException` occurs

## 3.20.0

- Release date: May 21, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/aca0accb170e43b280ee6443ab829d34/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1106204

### New Functionality

- New builder pattern for type `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy` to enable custom function decoration properties.
- A new, experimental interface `ServiceWithNavigableEntities` for OData v4 VDM, to allow for recursive traversal of navigation properties in entity sets. This generic type offers type-safe methods to create a request along chained entities with their navigation properties. By delegating to the existing request builder classes, the interface supports all basic CRUD operations, plus count. You can use all existing request modifiers, e.g. _filter_ or _select_ statements in _Read_. The interface type is `@Beta` annotated to declare methods and sub-types are still open for changes in the future.

  - Example

    - Create a new Trip in Vacation (id 2020) of Person (username "John")
    - HTTP request: `POST /ODataService/People('John')/Vacations(2020)/Trips`
    - Sample code:

      ```
      Trip tripItem;

      CreateRequestBuilder<Trip> createRequest = service
        .forEntity( Person.builder().username("John").build() )
        .navigateTo( Person.VACATIONS )
        .forEntity( Vacation.builder().id(2020).build() )
        .navigateTo( Vacation.TRIPS )
        .create( tripItem );

      createRequest.execute( destination );
      ```

- Add public methods `String getApplicationUrl()` and `String getApplicationProcessId()` to `ScpCfCloudPlatform` and expose them in `CloudPlatform` to partially match the existing public API of subtype `ScpNeoCloudPlatform`.

### Improvements

- Renamed module `odata-v4-client` to `odata-client` and packages contained from `c.s.c.s.datamodel.odatav4.client` to `c.s.c.s.datamodel.odata.client`. Only API that is declared unstable is affected so changes are only required if unstable parts of the API are being used explicitly.
- The OData generator (so the `odata-generator`, `odata-generator-cli`, and `odata-generator-maven-plugin` modules) are now able to also parse swagger files according to the OpenAPI v3 spec (in addition to the already supported OpenAPI v2 spec).

## 3.19.1

- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1095583

### Compatibility Notes

- As part of the update of the OData VDM to SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2005, in the `Inbound Delivery (A2X) - API_INBOUND_DELIVERY_SRV_0002` API, some previously published methods that were not actually supported by the S/4 system (like CRUD support for entity `MaintenanceItemObjList`) were removed from the SAP API Business Hub and as a consequence, from the SDK.

### New Functionality

- OData client: Update the OData VDM to the [newest release 2005 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2020/04/sap-s4hana-cloud-release-2005/). The SDK supports all OData services listed in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPS4HANACloud?section=Artifacts).
- Update the Message VDM to the newest release 2005 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

## 3.19.0

- Release date: April 30, 2020

### New Functionality

- Introducing the client library for the Workflow API on SAP Cloud Platform, Cloud Foundry

  - Example usage:

  ```
  final HttpDestination httpDestination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination(destinationName).asHttp();

  final List<WorkflowDefinition> workflowDefinitions =
                  new WorkflowDefinitionsApi(httpDestination).getWorkflowDefinitions();
  ```

  - Maven dependency:

  ```
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.services</groupId>
      <artifactId>scp-workflow-cf</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```

- New VDM request builder for OData v4 to fetch the count of entries in an entity collection endpoint. The result is a non-null Long, the number of matching entries according to optional filter and search expressions.
  - Example for the VDM usage:
    ```
    long numEntries = new DefaultEntityService()
      .countEntities()
      .filter(SomeEntity.FIELDNAME.contains("foo"))
      .search("bar")
      .execute(someDestination);
    ```
  - Example for the generic usage:
    ```
    long numEntries = new CountRequestBuilder<>("/odata/service/path/", SomeEntity.class)
      .filter(SomeEntity.FIELDNAME.contains("foo"))
      .search("bar")
      .execute(someDestination);
    ```
- Provide support for unbound actions in OData v4. The OData v4 generator generates unbound actions at the service level. Etag handling in actions is still not supported.
  - Note: Regenerate the VDM to enable these features on your classes.
- The VDM request builders for OData v4 to delete and update entities `DeleteRequestBuilder` and `UpdateRequestBuilder`
  allow to influence the submission of the version identifier (ETag) of the respective entity in the remote system.
  - The method `disableVersionIdentifier` allows to avoid that the request header `If-Match` is sent at all.
  - The method `matchAnyVersionIdentifier` allows to control that the request header `If-Match` is sent with the value `*`.
  - Note that if both methods are invoked on the same request builder, the latest invocation takes precedence.
  - Example for the VDM usage to delete an entity without sending a version identifier:
  ```
  new DefaultEntityService()
  .deleteEntity(entity)
  .disableVersionIdentifier()
  .execute(destination);
  ```
  - Example for the VDM usage to update an entity while sending the `*` value in the request header:
    ```
    new DefaultEntityService()
    .updateEntity(entity)
    .matchAnyVersionIdentifier()
    .execute(destination);
    ```

## 3.18.0

- Release date: April 23, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/2e07eccb70364934adc2e01239828e6b/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1086336

### Compatibility Notes

- The custom pmd plugin (com.sap.cloud.sdk.quality:pmd-plugin) was removed. The ruleset (com.sap.cloud.sdk.quality:pmd-rules) from now on contains only the rules shipped with the SAP Cloud SDK. All other imported rules were removed.
  To still use the ruleset with standard pmd plugin, especially in the SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery, we recommend adding the following configuration to the root pom of your project:

```
<build>
    <pluginManagement>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-pmd-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <rulesets>
                        <ruleset>rulesets/cloud-sdk-qualities.xml</ruleset>
                        <ruleset>rulesets/java/maven-pmd-plugin-default.xml</ruleset>
                    </rulesets>
                </configuration>
                <dependencies>
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.quality</groupId>
                        <artifactId>pmd-rules</artifactId>
                        <version>3.18.0</version>
                    </dependency>
                </dependencies>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
    ...
</build>
```

### Improvements

- Update Dependencies:
  - Spring Security from `5.3.0.RELEASE` to `5.3.1.RELEASE`
  - JUnit Pioneer from `0.5.5` to `0.5.6`
  - Java JWT from `3.10.1` to `3.10.2`
  - [SAP Cloud Security Client](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration) from `2.5.3` to `2.6.0`

## 3.17.2

- Release date: Apr 15, 2020

### Compatibility Notes

- The beta annotated `CustomOperationRequestBuilder` class has been renamed as `FunctionRequestBuilder`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue with access token validation in a provider/subscriber setup, when having multiple XSUAA service bindings, e.g. one with service plan `broker` and one with service plan `application`.

## 3.17.1

- Release date: April 9, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/a3be0ed889004b9485c980357ab6ad52/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1075911

### Improvements

- The interface `ResilienceDecorationStrategy` now provides an additional, optional argument to pass a custom `ExecutorService` in methods `decorateCallable` and `decorateSupplier`. This way the thread pool and task execution can be adjusted upon decoration. If the time limiter is enabled, it will be running in a thread through the passed executor. If `Callable` or `Supplier` lambda is queued, then the asynchronous task will be run with the given `ExecutorService` as well.

- For communication with XSUAA, the recommended [JWT Bearer Token Grant](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/74.16.0/index.html#saml2-bearer-grant) is now preferred over (discouraged) combination of [User Token Grant](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/74.16.0/index.html#user-token-grant) and [Refresh Token](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/74.16.0/index.html#refresh-token). This saves one internal HTTP request and the "uaa.user" scope is not necessary any longer in the `xs-security.json` configuration of the XSUAA service instance.

### Fixed Issues

- Fix unnecessary second request to destination service, when using proxy type "OnPremise" and authentication type "Principal Propagation".

- Fix a regression introduced in `3.16.1` where public keys for token validation are not cached.

## 3.17.0

- Release date: April 2, 2020

### New Functionality

- New support for [OData V4 - Deep Update](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html#sec_UpdateRelatedEntitiesWhenUpdatinganE).
  - Single and collection-based entity navigation properties can be used when updating a base entity. This way nested entities can be updated and created, while performing a single OData request.
  - **Note:** This feature can only be used with `UpdateRequestBuilder#modifyingEntity()` (default), and not with `UpdateRequestBuilder#replacingEntity()` (custom).
  - **Note:** Removing an existing element from a collection-based entity navigation property is not yet supported.

### Improvements

- The OData v4 VDM now allows for ordering by multiple fields through calling `orderBy` and passing fields to it with the corresponding order.

  ```java
    getPersons().orderBy(Person.FIRST_NAME.asc(), Person.LAST_NAME.desc());
  ```

- Update Dependencies

  - Update Java JWT from `3.10.0` to `3.10.1`
  - Update Mockito from `3.3.0` to `3.3.1`

  - Update Apache Commons Lang from version `3.9` to `3.10`
  - Update JUnit from version `5.6.0` to `5.6.1`
  - Update JUnit Pioneer from version `0.5.4` to `0.5.5`
  - Update Spring from version `5.2.4.RELEASE` to `5.2.5.RELEASE`

- Dependencies and Maven plugin versions in the archetypes `scp-cf-spring`, `scp-cf-tomee` and `scp-neo-javaee7` updated.
  - `jacoco-maven-plugin` updated to `0.8.5`
  - `maven-surefire-plugin` updated to `3.0.0-M4`
  - `maven-enforcer-plugin` updated to `3.0.0-M3`
  - `maven-war-plugin` updated to `3.2.3`
  - `maven-dependency-plugin` updated to `3.1.2`
  - Spring Boot updated from `2.2.1.RELEASE` to `2.2.5.RELEASE`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix a bug in the `odata-v4-generator` that causes fields of type `Edm.TimeOfDay` to not be recognized and thus generated properly, leading to missing `SimpleProperty` fields on the generated entity.

## 3.16.1

- Release date: March 26, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/059aaed870b44d8e8e24938c505b8120/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1068438

### Compatibility Notes

- As the Olingo dependency was removed from the Virtual Data Model (VDM), Olingo types are now set as custom fields and can be accessed by method [`getCustomField("fieldName")`](https://help.sap.com/doc/059aaed870b44d8e8e24938c505b8120/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/helper/VdmObject.html#getCustomField-java.lang.String-).

### New Functionality

- Introduce the module _SCP Blockchain Client Fabric_ for easy interaction with a Hyperledger Fabric network using all necessary configuration and credentials from a standardized user-provided service in the Cloud Foundry environment.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are now validated using their `issuer` and `jku` properties. Public keys for signature verification are fetched from the URL specified by the `jku` property. This only works if the `issuer` domain matches the domain of the XSUAA service. In case this fails or if the properties are not set, the implementation falls back to the previous validation mechanisms (e.g. verification key of XSUAA service binding, XSUAA token endpoint provider).

### Improvements

- Update Dependencies
  - Update Slf4J from version `1.7.26` to `1.7.30`
  - Update Jackson from version `2.10.2` to `2.10.3`
  - Update Wiremock from version `2.26.1` to `2.26.2`
  - Update Jetty from version `9.4.26.v20200117` to `9.4.27.v20200227`
  - Update Spring from version `5.2.3.RELEASE` to `5.2.4.RELEASE`
  - Update Apache HttpComponents from version `4.5.11` to `4.5.12`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix missing authorization header with Principal Propagation for OnPremise connectivitiy on CloudFoundry.
- Fix several special characters escaping and encoding issues.
  - `?` in the service path
  - `#` and `&` in filter and select expressions
  - `'` in string literals and in string parameters being passed in functions and `GetByKey` requests
  - `"` and `\` in search expressions

## 3.15.1

- Release date: March 12, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/19838225037e4e52ba36d2bb95176126/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1060707

### Compatibility Notes

- Use the library [XSUAA Token Client and Token Flow API](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/token-client) for handling communication with [XSUAA](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/ea0281368f11472b8d2b145a2a28666c.html) service instances.

  - If you mock XSUAA service requests in your tests, some assertions might need to be updated. When using the new library, XSUAA request parameters should be passed as _HTTP body content_ instead of query arguments.
  - The internally used types `SubdomainReplacer` and `DefaultSubdomainReplacer` became obsolete and were removed. The usage of this classes was replaced by the new library.
  - The behavior of following methods in the utility class `XsuaaService` has been changed.
    - `retrieveAccessTokenViaUserTokenGrant()`
    - `retrieveAccessTokenHeaderViaUserTokenGrant()`
      The old behavior is implemented in following methods.
    - `retrieveAccessTokenViaUserTokenExchange()`
    - `retrieveAccessTokenHeaderViaUserTokenExchange()`
      The change was made in order to better reflect on the internal logic of these methods. In addition to "Token Grant", the "Token Exchange" flavored operation will perform an authorization request with "Refresh Token" flow, which is required for [Principal Propagation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/67b0b94f09f2446598787eea0855e56b.html) when manually consuming the CloudFoundry _Connectivity Service_. Please update your code accordingly.

- The module `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:blockchain` has been renamed to `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:blockchain-client-multichain` to better reflect its focus on the Multichain Service.

### New Functionality

- Stabilize OData v4 Virtual Data Model (VDM). Following parts are considered stable as of this release:
  - `execute()` on all request builders (e.g., `CreateRequestBuilder)
  - `select()`, `filter()`, `top()`, `skip()`, and `search()` on `GetAllRequestBuilder`
  - `GetByKeyRequestBuilder.select()`
  - `of()`, `and()`, `or()`, `not()` for defining a `SearchExpression`
  - `includingFields()`, `replacingEntity()`, `modifyingEntity()` on `UpdateRequestBuilder`
  - The generic exception class `ODataException`
  - The classes `NavigationProperty`, `ComplexProperty` and `SimpleProperty`
  - The OData v4 generator now generates `ComplexProperty` fields on entities that can be used to build queries. Single instances and collections of complex types are supported.
- Provide support for unbound functions in OData v4. The OData v4 generator generates unbound functions at the service level.
- The OData v4 generator now creates entity classes that are only referenced by navigation properties and functions (not part of an entity set).

### Improvements

- Introduce snakeyaml version `1.26` as direct dependency and exclude the one used by the jackson library to overcome the security vulnerability [CVE-2017-18640](https://bitbucket.org/asomov/snakeyaml/issues/377/allow-configuration-for-preventing-billion).
- Replace the SAP Cloud SDK implementation for handling authentication and authorization within the SAP Cloud Platform landscape by the library [XSUAA Token Client and Token Flow API](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/master/token-client) version `2.5.1`. See the compatibility notes for details.
- Update Dependencies
  - [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html) from version `1.37.1` to `1.38.0`

  - Wiremock from version `2.20.0` to `2.26.1`
  - SAP Cloud Platform SDK For Neo Environment (Java EE 7 Web Profile TomEE 7) to version `1.69.18`

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where the OData v2 URL query generation was not escaping single-quotes `'` in String literals correctly. This character can now be used as part of entity keys and filter expressions.
- Fix an issue with `Decimal` OData values being formatted in unexpected scientific notation (e.g. `4.2e-7`) instead of expected decimal form (e.g. `0.00000042`). The solution is provided for serializing entity properties of Java type `BigDecimal`.

## 3.14.0

- Release date: February 27, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/65849d56440245959d8929e0db23d3c4/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1053508

### Compatibility Notes

- Remove the public enum `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationRetrievalStrategy` as it had no usage in the realm of the SAP Cloud SDK version 3.

### New Functionality

- _OData VDM client_: Add preview support for OData v4 services.
  - The new OData client implementation is capable of the basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations on OData v4 services.
  - Include an updated, dedicated generator that is capable of creating virtual data models through a command line interface or Maven plugin. Reference the artifact id `odata-v4-generator` in your `.pom` file.
  - Advanced features like functions, actions or batch requests are not yet supported.
  - The implementation is initially in beta and thus does not guarantee a stable API.

### Improvements

- Update [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html) from version `1.36.2` to `1.37.1`

## 3.13.0

- Release date: February 13, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/e03ee6cbe2ea468f88e1970b61d55b62/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1047125

### Compatibility Notes

- Updating [`WorkItems`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e03ee6cbe2ea468f88e1970b61d55b62/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/odata/namespaces/commercialproject/WorkItem.html) in the service [Commercial Project - Read](https://api.sap.com/api/_CPD_SC_EXTERNAL_SERVICES_SRV/resource) is no longer allowed as of SAP S/4HANA Cloud release 2002. The method `updateWorkItem()` was removed from [`CommercialProjectService`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e03ee6cbe2ea468f88e1970b61d55b62/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/odata/services/CommercialProjectService.html).

### New Functionality

- _OData client_: Update the OData VDM to the [newest release 2002 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2020/01/sap-s4hana-cloud-2002-release/). This includes completely new services (available as usual in package [com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services](https://help.sap.com/doc/e03ee6cbe2ea468f88e1970b61d55b62/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/odata/services/package-summary.html)), new operations in previously existing services, and new entity types. The SDK supports all OData services listed in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPS4HANACloud).

### Improvements

- Update the Spring dependency for the SAP Cloud Platform multitenancy implementation module to version `4.3.26.RELEASE` to overcome the security vulnerability [CVE-2020-5397](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=775438).

## 3.12.0

- Release date: January 30, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/3ef4616701f642658f0a7be6b2aaf587/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1039650

### New Functionality

- _SCP Blockchain Module_: Allow the usage of custom HTTP clients by adding support for a custom HTTP request factory for the rest template in [`MultichainRequest`](https://help.sap.com/doc/3ef4616701f642658f0a7be6b2aaf587/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/services/blockchain/multichain/service/MultichainRequest.html).
- When creating a [`MultichainService`](https://help.sap.com/doc/3ef4616701f642658f0a7be6b2aaf587/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/services/blockchain/multichain/service/MultichainService.html) instance using a SAP Cloud Platform destination, the destination's HTTP client will now be used as a pre-configured `HttpClient` instance with authentication, HTTP connection pooling, etc. for each [`MultichainRequest`](https://help.sap.com/doc/3ef4616701f642658f0a7be6b2aaf587/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/services/blockchain/multichain/service/MultichainRequest.html).

### Improvements

- Update dependencies:
  - Jackson from version `2.10.1` to `2.10.2`
  - Commons Codec from version `1.13` to `1.14`
  - Apache HttpComponents Core from version `4.4.12` to `4.4.13`.
  - Apache CXF from version `3.3.4` to `3.3.5`
  - JUnit Pioneer from version `0.4.2` to `0.5.1`
  - Spring from version `5.2.2.RELEASE` to `5.2.3.RELEASE`

### Fixed Issues

- _OData Generator_: Fix an issue where if only some of the declared EntitySets contained related service operations annotations in the `.edmx` file, the ones without such annotations got no operations resolved at all.
- Fix an issue with [`BapiRequest`](https://help.sap.com/doc/3ef4616701f642658f0a7be6b2aaf587/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/connectivity/rfc/BapiRequest.html) where a `NoSuchElementException` was thrown in case a [`Destination`](https://help.sap.com/doc/3ef4616701f642658f0a7be6b2aaf587/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/Destination.html) without a name was used.
- Fix an issue concerning the encoding of special characters such as `#`, `&`, etc. in OData filter expressions.

## 3.11.0

- Release date: January 16, 2020
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/?p=1031865

### Compatibility Notes

- The existence of a principal as retrieved by the [`PrincipalAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/principal/PrincipalAccessor.html) is no longer an indicator for a JWT to be present. Due to the introduction of [`BasicAuthenticationAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/BasicAuthenticationAccessor.html) a principal can also originate from the Basic Authentication header on the current request. As before verifying authentication and authorizations needs to be done explicitly by the application using the SAP Cloud SDK.

- The behavior for principal propagation when accessing on-premise systems has changed as explained below in the Improvements section.

### New Functionality

- Introduce a new [`BasicAuthenticationAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/BasicAuthenticationAccessor.html) to read the username and password from the Basic Authentication header of the currently incoming request on Cloud Foundry.

  - Use it like the other `*Accessor` classes:
    ```
    Try<BasicCredentials> basicCredentials = BasicAuthenticationAccessor.tryGetCurrentBasicCredentials();
    ```
  - To handle the `Try` gracefully you can write something like the following:
    ```
    BasicCredentials basicCredentials  = BasicAuthenticationAccessor.tryGetCurrentBasicCredentials().getOrElseGet(this::useFallbackCredentials);
    ```
  - To provide custom logic into the accessor the default logic can be overwritten by using the [`setBasicAuthenticationFacade()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/BasicAuthenticationAccessor.html#setBasicAuthenticationFacade-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.security.BasicAuthenticationFacade-) method:
    ```
    BasicAuthenticationAccessor.setBasicAuthenticationFacade(new CustomBasicAuthenticationFacade());
    ```

- Enable the [`PrincipalAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/principal/PrincipalAccessor.html) to also read the current principal from the newly introduced [`BasicAuthenticationAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/BasicAuthenticationAccessor.html), in addition to the already existing way to read it from the current JWT. This functionality applies to Cloud Foundry. A valid JWT takes precedence over a Basic Authentication header.

  The order of resolution is

  1. If a principal is given in the current context (e.g. via [`PrincipalAccessor.executeWithPrincipal()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/principal/PrincipalAccessor.html#executeWithPrincipal-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.security.principal.Principal-java.util.concurrent.Callable-)), this will we be used.
  2. Otherwise, if a JWT is given in the current context (e.g. via an incoming request or manually set via the [`AuthTokenAccessor.executeWithAuthToken()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/AuthTokenAccessor.html#executeWithAuthToken-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.security.AuthToken-java.util.concurrent.Callable-) methods) the principal is read from there.
  3. Otherwise, If there is no JWT or the resolution fails the user retrieved via the [`BasicAuthenticationAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/BasicAuthenticationAccessor.html) used (if existent).
  4. If no principal could be found with the steps above the `Try` returned by [`PrincipalAccessor.tryGetCurrentPrincipal()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/4cc23f4c3bf147fe834fbd0e3413e5d5/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/principal/PrincipalAccessor.html#tryGetCurrentPrincipal--) will contain an Exception.

- Support self-signed certificates (file extensions `.cer`, `.crt`, and `.der`) as trust store locations for HTTPS destinations.

### Improvements

- The connectivity to on-premise systems from SCP Cloud Foundry is updated, so that the [authentication](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/39f538ad62e144c58c056ebc34bb6890.html) now follows the [recommended](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/39f538ad62e144c58c056ebc34bb6890.html) protocol for principal propagation.

  - Instead of populating two headers `SAP-Connectivity-Authentication` and `Proxy-Authorization` for on-premise requests, the SAP Cloud SDK now takes the recommended approach of just using `Proxy-Authorization` with a dynamically resolved _User Exchange Access Token_.
  - Introduce `PrincipalPropagationStrategy` for configuring that the previous behavior should be used.

  If for compatibility reasons the previous approach should be used, you can adjust strategy with the following code snippet:

  ```java
  import com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.PrincipalPropagationStrategy;

  PrincipalPropagationStrategy.setDefaultStrategy(PrincipalPropagationStrategy.COMPATIBILITY);
  ```

- Support reading the principal from an OAuth SAML Bearer token on Cloud Foundry.

## 3.7.0

- Release date: November 7, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/11/07/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.7.0-and-for-java-1.12.0-for-javascript/

### Known Issues

- SDK version 3.7.0 references Jackson 2.10.0 which has two known security vulnerabilities, which were not yet fixed in time for version 3.7.0 of the SDK. Note that the SDK does not use the vulnerable functionality and is thus not vulnerable itself. If you use Jackson yourself, you should consider the relevant recommendations [CVE-2019-17267](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17267) and [CVE-2019-17531](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17531). For more details, also consider [this article with more background](https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062).

### Compatibility Notes

- The resilience configuration API has been adjusted as follows:
  - The parameter-less static factory method `RetryConfiguration.ofDefaults()` has been deprecated in favor of [`RetryConfiguration.of(maxAttempts)`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.RetryConfiguration.html#of-int-) to avoid unexpected, implicit behavior.
  - The deprecated methods `executeFutureSupplier` and `decorateFutureSupplier` have been removed from [`ResilienceDecorationStrategy`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorationStrategy.html) and [`ResilienceDecorator`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorator.html).
- The default buffer sizes for circuit breakers in [`CircuitBreakerConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CircuitBreakerConfiguration.html) have been changed as follows:
  - From 100 to 10 for transitioning from _CLOSED_ to _OPEN_ state.
  - From 10 to 5 for transitioning from _HALF-OPEN_ back to _CLOSED_ state.

### New Functionality

- Allow clearing the cache for future requests when using a [`ResilienceConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.html) with a [`CacheConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CacheConfiguration.html) in place. Use [`ResilienceDecorator.invalidateCache(configuration)`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorator.html#invalidateCache-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.resilience.ResilienceConfiguration-) to clear the cache associated with a specific configuration.
- _OData VDM generator_: allow to specify the copyright header for generated files by supplying the parameter `--copyright-header your-custom-header`. By default, no header is generated.

### Improvements

- Allow to explicitly specify buffer sizes for the [circuit breaker](https://resilience4j.readme.io/v0.17.0/docs/circuitbreaker) in `CircuitBreakerConfiguration`. Use [`CircuitBreakerConfiguration.closedBufferSize`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CircuitBreakerConfiguration.html#closedBufferSize-int-) and [`CircuitBreakerConfiguration.halfOpenBufferSize`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CircuitBreakerConfiguration.html#halfOpenBufferSize-int-) to provide custom values for the respective buffer size.
- Allow to specify the cache expiration strategy for a [`CacheConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CacheConfiguration.html) in [`ResilienceConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.html). Use [`withExpirationStrategy(strategy)`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CacheConfiguration.CacheConfigurationBuilder.html#withExpirationStrategy-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.resilience.CacheExpirationStrategy-) on the [builder for a CacheConfiguration](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CacheConfiguration.CacheConfigurationBuilder.html) with the enum constants available from [`CacheExpirationStrategy`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/CacheExpirationStrategy.html). [`WHEN_LAST_MODIFIED`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/CacheExpirationStrategy.html#WHEN_LAST_MODIFIED) remains the default value for the expiration strategy.
- Allow to initialize a resilience configuration with disabled individual properties by providing methods for instantiating a invidual configuration as disabled. Introduce the following factory methods in addition to the previously existing ones that instantiate an enabled configuration:
  - [`CircuitBreakerConfiguration.disabled()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CircuitBreakerConfiguration.html#disabled--)
  - [`TimeLimiterConfiguration.disabled()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.TimeLimiterConfiguration.html#disabled--)
  - [`BulkheadConfiguration.disabled()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.BulkheadConfiguration.html#disabled--)
  - [`RetryConfiguration.disabled()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.RetryConfiguration.html#disabled--)
  - [`CacheConfiguration.disabled()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.CacheConfiguration.html#disabled--)
- Provide method [`ResilienceConfiguration.empty`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.html#empty-java.lang.Class-) to initialize a new resilience configuration with all properties being disabled by default.
- Provide method [`TimeLimiterConfiguration.of(duration)`](https://help.sap.com/doc/e1e40a06a99c4b858481f11dcf336749/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.TimeLimiterConfiguration.html#of-java.time.Duration-) as a convenience instead of `TimeLimiterConfiguration.of().timeoutDuration(duration)`.

## 3.6.0

- Release date: October 24, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/928ed32b5bb9437db72a90ee0c096f41/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/10/24/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.6.0-for-java-and-1.11.3-for-javascript/

### Known Issues

- SDK version 3.6.0 references Jackson 2.10.0 which has two known security vulnerabilities, which were not yet fixed in time for version 3.6.0 of the SDK. For your reference, this concerned the following recommendations:
  - [CVE-2019-17267](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17267)
  - [CVE-2019-17531](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17531)

### Compatibility Notes

- The overridable method `getJsonResponseObjectName()` of base class [`FluentHelperFunction`](https://help.sap.com/doc/928ed32b5bb9437db72a90ee0c096f41/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/helper/FluentHelperFunction.html) has been deprecated in favor of its successor [`refineJsonResponse`](https://help.sap.com/doc/928ed32b5bb9437db72a90ee0c096f41/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/helper/FluentHelperFunction.html#refineJsonResponse-com.google.gson.JsonElement-). Both reside in `protected` scope and are therefore only used to customize the default behavior. The new method allows limitless modification of the response JSON element during the refinement step of the deserialization process for function import responses.

### New Functionality

- Offer retries as part of [`ResilienceConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/928ed32b5bb9437db72a90ee0c096f41/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.html) via a [`RetryConfiguration`](https://help.sap.com/doc/928ed32b5bb9437db72a90ee0c096f41/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceConfiguration.RetryConfiguration.html).
  - Retries allow for re-attempting a request in case it fails a limited number of times.
  - The feature offers to specify the maximum amount of attempts, a wait duration between attempts and a predicate that determines, whether or not a failure should be retried.

### Improvements

- _OData VDM generator_: Mark generated sources for compilation when using `odata-generator-maven-plugin`. For this feature just add the property `<compileScope>...</compileScope>` with the compilation phase to your configuration. Valid values are `COMPILE`, `TEST_COMPILE`, and `NONE`, representing the different compile phases or no automatic compilation at all. The default value (for backwards compatibility reasons) is `NONE`.
- Update dependencies:
  - Jackson from version 2.9.10 to 2.10.0.
  - Lombok from version 1.18.8 to 1.18.10.
  - Guava from version 28.0-jre to 28.1-jre.
  - GSON from version 2.8.5 to 2.8.6.
  - Java JWT from version 3.8.1 to 3.8.3.
  - Commons-Text from version 1.7 to 1.8.
  - Http Core from version 4.4.11 to 4.4.12.
  - Http Components Client from version 4.5.9 to 4.5.10.
  - Resilience4J from version 0.17.0 to 1.1.0.

### Fixed Issues

- _OData VDM_: Fix an issue where the response of function imports was not correctly handled. The response is now parsed according to OData specification. The deviating behavior of OData services in some SAP solution is still supported as in previous versions, via a (modifiable) refinement step.
- _OData VDM generator_: Parse allowed requests in a more careful manner when handling an EDMX file. The generator will no longer throw an exception for missing XML attributes.
- Fix an issue regarding timeouts in the execution of resilient requests. The issue prevented threads from being terminated when a timeout occurs.

## 3.5.0

- Release date: October 10, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/2656a317c96d481b9216b8882f1eadad/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/08/10/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.5.0-for-java-1.11.2-for-javascript-and-v25-of-continuous-delivery-toolkit/

### Compatibility Notes

- Previous versions of the SDK only recognized an access token in the authorization header if "`Bearer`" was spelled in title case. Now, corresponding methods do a case insensitive check for "`bearer`". That means, "bearer" and "Bearer" are now equally supported as correct authorization header.
- _OData VDM generator_: The generator now identifies which CRUD operations an entity set supports by first consulting the [annotations based on the OData specification](https://oasis-tcs.github.io/odata-vocabularies/vocabularies/Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.html). Only when these annotations are not declared, the custom SAP specifications are considered.

### Improvements

- No longer require a binding to an XSUAA service instance when consuming the destination or connectivity service via the SDK.
- Automatically read the principal ID from the `user_name` claim of the current JWT in [`ScpCfPrincipalFacade`](https://help.sap.com/doc/2656a317c96d481b9216b8882f1eadad/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/principal/ScpCfPrincipalFacade.html) when the JWT has the `user_token` grant type.
- Update dependencies on Jackson from `2.9.9`/`2.9.9.2` to `2.9.10`.
- Verify that the Maven `artifactId` does not contain an underscore character when creating a project using the `scp-cf-spring` and `scp-cf-tomee` archetypes. This is necessary as the artifact ID will also be used as Cloud Foundry application name and the deployment to Cloud Foundry will fail if the application name contains an underscore.

## 3.4.0

- Release date: September 26, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/d17b8bdb22f84c7eb7924408abeea492/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/09/26/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.4.0-for-java-1.10.0-for-javascript-and-v24-of-continuous-delivery-toolkit/

### Compatibility Notes

- In preparation for an upcoming change to the way how the XSUAA service supplies verification keys to applications, the SAP Cloud SDK from version 3.4.0 onwards retrieves the key from the XSUAA service instead of relying on a verification key present in the XSUAA service binding credentials.
- Remove dependency `rest-assured` from the [`sdk-bom`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk/sdk-bom/3.4.0/pom). Projects that depends on it must now declare a version explicitly. This also removes the need to explicitly declare a version of `hamcrest-core` and `hamcrest-library` since they were previously both introduced as transitive dependencies via `jUnit` and `rest-assured` but had conflicting versions.

### Improvements

- Validate user access tokens issued by XSUAA with the verification key retrieved from the XSUAA service, instead of relying on a verification key present in the XSUAA service binding credentials. The retrieved key is cached for 5 minutes (depending on feedback, the cache duration may change in the future).
- Support `SystemUser` property in destinations with authentication type "OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion". The system user will be used instead of the currently logged in principal to retrieve an access token to the destination. That is, no principal propagation takes place. As a consequence, no user JWT is required.

## 3.3.1

- Release date: September 12, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/6599292dcb7243bc95071d9d1757a30f/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/09/12/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.3.1-for-java-and-1.9.0-for-javascript/

### Compatibility Notes

- The OData VDM Generator now constructs the service URL based on the service name from the namespace provided in the metadata file. The previously used filename is only considered as the service name in case the namespace does not not provide the information.

### Improvements

- _OData VDM Generator_: use the service name from the namespace provided in the metadata file to construct the service name part of the OData request URL. Fall back to the filename of the metadata file as the service name only if the namespace information is not available.
- Update dependency to Java libraries of [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html) (`com.sap.cloud.servicesdk.*`) from version 1.32.5 to 1.33.0.
- Remove `listeners-all` dependencies from projects generated via archetypes since the SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline will inject this dependency during a pipeline run.

## 3.2.0

- Release date: August 29, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/08/29/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.2.0-for-java-1.8.1-for-javascript-and-v23-of-continuous-delivery-toolkit/

### Compatibility Notes

- The following methods in the resilience module have been deprecated in favor of the new methods introduced for asynchronous resilient execution: `decorateFutureSupplier` and `executeFutureSupplier` in [`ResilienceDecorator`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorator.html), `decorateFutureSupplier` and `executeFutureSupplier` in [`ResilienceDecorationStrategy`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorationStrategy.html).
- _OData VDM_: we have added deprecation information to service classes that represent SAP S/4HANA Cloud APIs which are deprecated on the SAP API Business Hub, such as `ChangeMasterService`, `ProcessOrderConfirmationService`, and `ProductionOrderConfirmationService`. Take a look at the corresponding Javadoc and use the appropriate successor service listed therein.

### New Functionality

- Execute code asynchronously while making it resilient, using the new methods [`queueCallable`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorator.html#queueCallable-java.util.concurrent.Callable-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.resilience.ResilienceConfiguration-) and [`queueSupplier`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorator.html#queueSupplier-java.util.function.Supplier-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.resilience.ResilienceConfiguration-) of [`ResilienceDecorator`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorator.html) that return instances of `CompletableFuture`. Corresponding methods are also available from [`ResilienceDecorationStrategy`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/resilience/ResilienceDecorationStrategy.html).

### Improvements

- _OData VDM Generator_: add deprecation information contained in the provided Swagger file of a service to generated service classes.
- Update dependencies:
  - Java libraries of [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html) (`com.sap.cloud.servicesdk.*`) from version 1.32.0 to 1.32.5
  - Caffeine from 2.7.0 to 2.8.0
  - Commons Codec from 1.12.0 to 1.13.0
  - CXF from 3.2.6 to 3.3.2
  - Resilience4J from 0.16.0 to 0.17.0
  - JUnit from 5.5.0-M1 to 5.5.1
  - AssertJ Core from 3.12.2 to 3.13.2
  - Joda Time from 2.10.2 to 2.10.3
- Reduce log verbosity of [`ThreadContextExecutor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/thread/ThreadContextExecutor.html) and the accessor classes that use it (e.g. `execute...` methods in [`TenantAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/tenant/TenantAccessor.html)).

### Fixed Issues

- _OData VDM_: Fix an issue with function imports where special characters in query parameters, e.g. spaces, led to wrong URLs.
- Fix an issue with [`XsuaaService`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/XsuaaService.html) where it always forcibly used the provider tenant when calling `retrieveAccessToken...` methods. Now the methods retrieve access tokens for the tenant that called the method.
- Fix an issue with error handling in functions of [`MultichainService`](https://help.sap.com/doc/ef9bbec49d7d4c229d5e4e6295476572/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/services/blockchain/multichain/service/MultichainService.html) so that it appropriately throws instances of `MultichainException`.

## 3.1.0

- Release date: August 15, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/08/15/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.1.0-for-java-and-1.8.0-for-javascript/

### Compatibility Notes

- As part of the update of the OData VDM to SAP S/4HANA Cloud 1908, the `OutboundDeliveryService` has been removed from the SAP API Business Hub and, as a consequence, from the SDK. Use [`OutboundDeliveryV2Service`](https://help.sap.com/doc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/odata/services/OutboundDeliveryV2Service.html) instead.
- The destination expected as the second parameter of the [`attachToService()`](https://help.sap.com/doc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/helper/VdmEntity.html#attachToService-java.lang.String-com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.HttpDestinationProperties-) method of [`VdmEntity`](https://help.sap.com/doc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/datamodel/odata/helper/VdmEntity.html) is now mandatory (`@Nonnull`), rather than nullable because attaching to a service does not work without a destination to designate the target system.

### New Functionality

- OData VDM: Update the OData virtual data model to the [newest release 1908 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2019/08/sap-s4hana-cloud-1908-new-release/). This includes completely new services (available as usual as from package [`com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.odata.services`](https://help.sap.com/doc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/odata/services/package-summary.html)), new operations in previously existing services, and new entity types. The SDK supports all OData services listed in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/shell/discover/contentpackage/SAPS4HANACloud).
- Message VDM: Update the message virtual data model for the [newest release 1908 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2019/08/sap-s4hana-cloud-1908-new-release/). This includes 21 new message types to reflect the new event types added in SAP S/4HANA Cloud (available as usual from package [`com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana.datamodel.messaging.api.message`](https://help.sap.com/doc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/s4hana/datamodel/messaging/api/message/package-summary.html)). The SDK supports all event types listed in the [SAP API Business Hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPS4HANACloudBusinessEvents?section=Artifacts).

### Improvements

- Update dependency to Jackson Databind to version `2.9.9.2` (from `2.9.9.1`) in order to fix reported security vulnerabilities.

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where [`DefaultHttpDestination`](https://help.sap.com/doc/0c49e20a27384c3abfcd8fdec643406b/1.0/en-US/index.html?com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.html) failed to load the authentication type, so that authentication was not correctly applied when loading destinations from an environment variable or instantiating `DefaultHttpDestination` manually.
- Fix issues with HTTP destinations in the SAP Cloud Platform Neo environment when using EJBs to run code on server startup.

## 3.0.0

- Release date: August 1, 2019
- Javadoc: https://help.sap.com/http.svc/rc/ae45330c443b42c5a54bde85dd70aec9/1.0/en-US/index.html
- Release blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2019/08/01/new-versions-of-sap-cloud-sdk-3.0.0-for-java-and-1.7.0-for-javascript/

### Known Issues

When defining destinations via the environment variable destinations, version 3.0.0 does not use basic authentication even if credentials are given. Either update to version 3.1.0 or manually add the following properties to the JSON defining a destination: "authentication": "BasicAuthentication", "authType": "BasicAuthentication".

### Compatibility Notes

- Update several implementations of destination classes to the new Destination API.
  - Change the _Extension Factory_ destination loader class: Now `ScpXfDestinationLoader` extends from generic `ScpVcapDestinationLoader`.
- Introduce separate enums by a platform for destination retrieval strategy.
  - ScpCfDestinationRetrievalStrategy and ScpNeoDestinationRetrievalStrategy
  - Removed the PLATFORM_DEFAULT value from all destination retrieval strategy enums.
    - Use null values instead, or do not set the parameter at all.
- Removed the destination retrieval strategy configuration from the DestinationAccessor. It is no longer a global configuration by destination name.

  - Destination retrieval strategy configuration is now stored in instances of the new DestinationOptions class.
  - To set the destination retrieval strategy, use the ScpCfDestinationOptionsHelper or ScpNeoDestinationOptionsHelper with the builder of DestinationOptions.
  - e.g. on Cloud Foundry:
    ```
    final DestinationOptions destinationOptions = DestinationOptions.builder()
            .parameter("myParameter", myValue)
            .augmentBuilder(ScpCfDestinationOptionsHelper.augmenter()
                .retrievalStrategy(ScpCfDestinationRetrievalStrategy.SUBSCRIBER_THEN_PROVIDER))
            .augmentBuilder((new MyDestinationOptionsAugmenter())
                .myCustomParameter1(myCustomValue1)
                // any number of custom parameters
                .myCustomParameterN(myCustomValueN))
            // other parameters/augmenters you need
            .build();
    ```

- Use the new ResilienceDecorator class to wrap logic instead of extending the Command class.
- Configure resilience using the new ResilienceConfiguration class. ResilienceDecorator requires at least a unique identifier configured.
- Configure caching within the ResilienceConfiguration class by providing an instance of CacheConfiguration class.
  - As a parameter, CacheConfiguration requires at least a value for a duration until the cache entry will be expired.
  - Additional items can be attached as part of the dynamic cache key.
    If these items are `Serializable` then the cache key itself automatically becomes serializable as well.
    This fulfills a requirement for some caching configurations.
  - The caching strategy only works, when a service provider for (JSR-107 / JCache) is registered at runtime.
- Can provide fallback functions, which are executed when the wrapped code throws exceptions.
- Ability to configure ResilienceDecorator with a custom function decoration strategy by implementing the ResilienceDecorationStrategy interface.
- Removed the ODataRequestCommand since it's no longer needed by VDM fluent helpers.
- Classes ODataServicesQueryCommand, SqlQueryCommand, BapiQueryCommand, RfcQueryCommand, HierarchyQueryCommand, and UserProfileQueryCommand have been removed.
  The execute() method of queries can be easily wrapped using ResilienceDecorator instead.
- Removed the asResilientCommand() methods from all VDM fluent helpers.
  The execute() method of VDM fluent helpers can be easily wrapped using ResilienceDecorator instead.
- Internal only: Removed the SigningServiceCommand class. Use instead the SigningServiceErpQuerySigner class.

- Classes referred to with "query" are renamed to "request", in case their main purpose is to read result data.

- RequestContext is now ThreadContext
  - New concept of ThreadContextDecorator to allow decorating the callable which is wrapped in a ThreadContext.
    The difference to ThreadContextListener is that the listener is responsible for setting ThreadContext properties, while the decorator allows decorating the callable that is wrapped in the ThreadContext.
  - Now there is a RequestAccessor
  - Rename RequestContextServletFilter to RequestAccessorFilter
  - DestinationsRequestContextListener has been renamed to HttpClientsThreadContextListener to better reflect its purpose
- Lenient behavior
- USE_MOCKED_TENANT, USE_MOCKED_USER, and ALLOW_MOCKED_AUTH_HEADER are no longer available.
- TenantNotAvailableException etc. were removed and replaced with Option.
- Principal replaces User.
  - No Locale as part of principal anymore (only available on Neo, cast to ScpNeoPrincipal if needed)
  - No `hasAuthorizations` method, use authorizations with "contains" method of setting
  - CacheKey and CacheManager have been adjusted accordingly to reflecting naming: the user is now principal
  - AccessDeniedException also now uses "principal" instead of "user" (note, however, that the AccessDeniedResponse still exposes "user" to remain compatible on REST API level).
- LocalScopePrefixProvider now uses Try instead of throwing exceptions that were previously not declared on the API.
- Remove ErpEdition (also removed in the mocking of ErpSystem)
- Accessors now use vavr in more places (offering methods returning Try).
- TenantAccessor, PrincipalAccessor, AuthTokenAccessor, and RequestAccessor now support on-behalf execution, with-fallback execution, and a global fallback.
- SapPassportBuilder now uses the following defaults:
  - "SAP_CLOUD_SDK_APPLICATION" instead of "S4SDK_APPLICATION"
  - "SAP_CLOUD_SDK_USER" instead of "S4SDK_USER"
  - "SAP_CLOUD_SDK_REQUEST" instead of "S4SDK_REQUEST"
- Add a new module security-servlet containing servlet-based security filters.
  Note that this may require that you add the following dependency to your project if you rely on these web filters:
  ```
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.sap.cloud.s4hana.cloudplatform</groupId>
      <artifactId>security-servlet</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  ```
- Remove CloudLoggerFactory along with pipeline rule

- MockUtil no longer mocks platform-specific classes, but only interface. Mock the facade manually, if you have to rely on the specific class.
- MockUtil no longer offers methods for mocking destinations or servers with the default destination name "MyDestination". The destination name now is a mandatory parameter.

- The following maven dependencies have been updated:

- The dependency `org.checkerframework:checker-qual` has been excluded entirely. That is, it is neither a direct dependency of the SDK anymore, nor is it a transitive dependency of both Caffeine and Guava.

- Renamed/Moved Modules. Our goals with the renaming were the following:
  - Use the prefix `com.sap.cloud.sdk` instead of `com.sap.cloud.s4hana`.
  - Make all artifact ids unique, so that tools gradle can easily consume our modules.
  - The term `s4hana` in the group id is only used if the contained module is in some way specific for SAP S/4HANA.
  - Remove all obsolete modules.

### New Functionality

- Provide builders to construct destinations explicitly by providing values for properties in code, for example, DefaultHttpDestination.builder or ScpCfHttpDestination.builder.
- Give more control when loading a destination by providing DestinationOptions.
  - Different destination loaders such as ScpCfDestinationLoader or ScpNeoDestinationLoader will consider different options that give fine-granular control over the behavior when loading the destination (for example, if provider or subscriber destinations shall take precedence).
  - Construct a DestinationOptions instance via the builder method.
  - Use the augmentBuilder method to set configuration parameters that are specific to a loader (platform or environment) using an appropriate class implementing DestinationOptionsAugmenter.
- Execute code (given as Callable or Executable) by overriding (that is, "on-behalf of") the Tenant, Principal, or AuthToken of the context in TenantAccessor, PrincipalAccessor, and AuthTokenAccessor.
  - At the example of TenantAccessor.executeWithTenant, the given callable/executable will be executed in a context where the given tenant is set as the current tenant.
  - In addition to overriding, provide the option to set a fallback for a single execution (for example, with TenantAccessor.executeWithFallbackTenant) or globally (for example, with TenantAccessor.setFallbackTenant). Whenever, for example, a tenant is requested but not available, the SDK will retrieve a fallback tenant from the given supplier.
- Offer access to the current request, if available, via the new RequestAccessor and allow overriding the request and providing a fallback request when executing code.
- Make XsuaaService public for communicating with a given XSUAA service on SAP Cloud Platform, Cloud Foundry.

### Improvements

- Decouple the implementation of resilient behavior from a concrete framework with the generic functional-style adapters in com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.resilience. Provide default implementation of resilience using resilience4j as underlying library.
  - Provide ResilienceDecorator as the entry point for wrapping any code (callable or supplier) with resilient behavior.
  - Provide ResilienceConfiguration
- Allow using any JSR-107 (JCache) compliant library for caching as part of resilience.
- Allow nesting of ThreadContexts.
- Improve log output on log level "debug" for DefaultMessageDelegator to improve error inspection in the messaging core module.
