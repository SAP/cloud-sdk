## Getting Started with the SAP Cloud SDK on Kyma

The getting started guide for the Kyma environment is pending.
It shouldn't stop you from using this environment with the SAP Cloud SDK for Java.
In the meanwhile check the example [App and comprehensive instructions](https://github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples/tree/main/sample-cloudsdk-java) by our Kyma colleagues.
As Kyma is backed by Kubernetes, many of the topics mentioned in our [SAP Gardener](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/environments/sap-btp-kubernetes-environment-with-sap-gardener) guide also apply to Kyma, for example the [Excursion: Bind Services created by the Service Catalog](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/environments/sap-btp-kubernetes-environment-with-sap-gardener#excursion-bind-services-created-by-the-service-catalog).
