[SAP Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) is a managed Kubernetes service by SAP developed as an Open Source project.
Essentially, Gardener is a thin layer of conventions on top of the plain Kubernetes.
It helps create and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters with less effort by abstracting environment specifics to deliver the same homogeneous Kubernetes-native DevOps experience everywhere.

## SAP Cloud SDK Features Supported on SAP Gardener

The SAP Cloud SDK supports SAP Gardener-based Kubernetes clusters out of the box. 

Find below the list of features we currently support:

- ✅ Consume SAP BTP services like Destination, Connectivity, IAS, XSUAA, and others
- ✅ Multitenancy
- ✅ Resilience & Caching
- ✅ Connect to and consume services from SAP S/4HANA Cloud
- ❌ Connect to and consume services from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise
- ✅ Seamless use of typed clients provided by the SAP Cloud SDK

## Getting Started with the SAP Cloud SDK on Gardener

This detailed guide will help get your SAP Cloud SDK Java application up and running in the SAP Gardener-based Kubernetes cluster.
You can also use this guide to migrate your existing application to Kubernetes.

:::tip

For additional information on more deployment options you can also check out the [guide for JavaScript](http://localhost:3000/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/migrate-sdk-application-from-btp-cf-to-kubernetes#configure-tls-and-obtain-a-domain-in-sap-gardener).

:::

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide you will need:

- A [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) managed cluster
- The [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator/) installed in the Cluster
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and a publicly reachable Docker repository
- A [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) Application using the SAP Cloud SDK

Check out the details below in case you are uncertain about any of the prerequisites.

<details>
  <summary>Gardener Cluster</summary>

This guide assumes you have created a cluster via Gardener dashboard, have [Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed on your local machine and have it set up for cluster access.

:::tip
Running `kubectl cluster-info` should print out your cluster endpoints.

In case you haven't set this up you can do so by downloading a `kubeconfig` from your Gardener dashboard.
You can read more about accessing clusters using `kubeconfig` on the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
:::

We also recommend to have an Ingress set up that exposes the application to the internet.
You can read more about configuring an Ingress on the [Gardener documentation](https://gardener.cloud/docs/guides/applications/service-access/#loadbalancer-vs-ingress).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>SAP BTP Service Operator</summary>

This guide assumes you have the [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/Cloud/en-US/b5a35bfa87b5444080e6e6e6d361fa20.html) installed in your cluster.
The operator is used to create and bind service instances.
The same can also be achieved via the [Service Catalog](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/Cloud/en-US/20195bf3b6e64189966e08f669c275e1.html).
However, this guide will focus on the Service Operator usage.

:::tip
In case you don't have it installed please follow the [documentation](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator#sap-business-technology-platform-sap-btp-service-operator-for-kubernetes) to install it.
:::

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Docker</summary>

This guide assumes you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your local machine.

Furthermore, you need a **Docker repository** where you can store images.
The repository needs to be publicly accessible in order for the cluster to access and download the Docker image we are going to create.

In case you don't have such a repository yet we recommend either:

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- [Artifactory DMZ](https://common.repositories.cloud.sap/ui/) (for SAP internal developers)

Access to images in a repository may be limited to authenticated and/or authorized users, depending on your configuration.

Make sure you are logged in to your repository on your local machine by running:

```bash
docker login (your-repo) --username=(your-username)
```

And check your configuration which is usually located under `(your-home-directory)/.docker/config.json`.

:::tip
In case AuthN/AuthZ is required to download images make sure you have a [secret configured in your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line):

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry (name-of-the-secret) --docker-username=(username) --docker-password=(API-token) --docker-server=(your-repo)
```

:::

<details>
  <summary>Application using the SAP Cloud SDK</summary>

If you don't have an application already you can comfortably [create one from our archetypes](../getting-started).

</details>

### Containerize the Application

To run on Kubernetes the application needs to be shipped in a container.
For this guide we will be using Docker.

Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root directory:

```dockerfile {2}
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
ARG JAR_FILE=application/target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

If needed, update the `JAR_FILE` to point to your JAR file.

:::tip
You can find more information on how to containerize Spring Boot applications in [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker/) (in particular, check the _Containerize It_ section).
:::

Compile and push the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t <your-repo>/<your-image-name> .
docker push <your-repo>/<your-image-name>
```

:::tip
In case you are facing authorization issues when pushing to your repository refer to the dedicated section under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
:::

### Create a Kubernetes Deployment

1. Create a new YAML file describing the Kubernetes deployment:

   ```yml title="deployment.yml" {18,32}
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
           # Configure the docker image you just pushed to your repository here
           - image: <your-repo>/<your-image>:latest
             name: my-app
             imagePullPolicy: Always
             resources:
               requests:
                 memory: '1Gi'
                 cpu: '500m'
               limits:
                 memory: '1.5Gi'
                 cpu: '750m'
             # Volume mounts needed for injecting BTP service credentials
             volumeMounts:
         imagePullSecrets:
           # In case your repository requires a login, reference your secret here
           - name: <your-secret-for-docker-login>
         # Volumes containing BTP serice credentials from secrets
         volumes:
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: my-app
     name: my-app
     namespace: default
   spec:
     type: NodePort
     ports:
       - port: 8080
     selector:
       app: my-app
   ```

2. Install the configuration via `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`.

3. Monitor the status of the deployment by running: `kubectl get deployment my-app-deployment`.

Eventually, you should see an output similar to:

```
$ kubectl get deployment my-app-deployment

NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
my-app-deployment   1/1     1            1           15s
```

:::tip
In case something went wrong use `kubectl describe` together with `deployment` or `pod` to get more information about the status of your application.
:::

### Create an Ingress

To make your application available from outside the cluster we will create an Ingress.

:::note
In case you already have an Ingress configured in your cluster only add the new `rule` for your new applications.

You can read more about configuring an Ingress on the [Gardener documentation](https://gardener.cloud/docs/guides/applications/service-access/#loadbalancer-vs-ingress).
:::

1. Create a new YAML file containing the following Ingress configuration:

```yml title="ingress.yml" {12-13,16}
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-router
  namespace: default
  annotations:
  # cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
      # - "<your-cluster-host>"
      # - "*.ingress.<your-cluster-host>"
    # secretName: secret-tls
  rules:
    - host: 'my-app.ingress.<your-cluster-host>'
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

2. Install the configuration via `kubectl apply -f ingress.yml`.

3. Verify the Ingress is up and running: `kubectl describe ingress ingress-router`

You should see an entry with the path `/` pointing to the backend `my-app`.

:::note
In case something went wrong and you are struggling to configure the Ingress you can also come back and set it up later.
The Ingress is a convenient way to access your application.
It is not strictly required for the rest of this guide.
:::

<details>
  <summary>Recommended: Configure TLS for your Ingress</summary>

Enable the NGINX Ingress add-on in your Gardener dashboard.
The process may take a few minutes.
Afterwards, you should see a domain in the dashboard as well as a Kubernetes secret `secret-tls`.

Un-comment the 4 lines in the YAML above using the generated domain and secret.
Then re-deploy the configuration as usual.
Your cluster endpoint should now be trusted by your browser.

</details>

:::tip
We highly recommended enabling TLS for your cluster endpoints.
It ensures your client (e.g. browser) can verify the cluster's identity.
:::

### Access Your Application

At this point take a moment to verify you can access your application.
Use the host you have defined in your Ingress rule in a browser or other tool of your choice (e.g. Postman).
In case you started with an SAP Cloud SDK Archetype your should be greeted with a welcome page under the root path.

:::note
In case you skipped setting up an Ingress before you can use port forwarding to access your application.

Identify the pod name of your application with `kubectl get pods`.
Then enable port forwarding to it by running: `kubectl port-forward (your-pod-name) 8080:8080`.
With that you should be able to access the application on your `http://localhost:8080`
:::

### Bind SAP BTP Services to the Application

The SAP Business Technology Platform offers various services that can be used by applications.
To access services from a Kubernetes environment instances have to be created and bound to the application.

For this guide we'll assume we want to use two services:

1. Destination Service
2. Identity and Authentication Service (IAS)

#### Bind the Destination Service

1. Create a new YAML file:

```yml title="destination-service.yaml"
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: destination-service
spec:
  serviceOfferingName: destination
  servicePlanName: lite
  externalName: default-destination-service
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: my-destination-service-binding
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: destination-service
  secretName: my-destination-service-secret
  secretKey: my-destination-service-key
```

2. Install the configuration via `kubectl apply -f destination-service.yml`.

3. Monitor the status via `kubectl describe ServiceInstance destination-service`.
   Eventually this should automatically create a Kubernetes secret named `my-destination-service-secret`.
   This secret will contain the actual service binding information.

4. Mount the `my-destination-service-secret` secret into the file system of the application as follows:

   1. Find the empty list of `volumes` at the end of your `deployment.yml`.
      Add a new volume, referencing the secret:

      ```yml title="volumes:"
      - name: my-destination-service-binding-volume
        secret:
          secretName: my-destination-service-secret
      ```

   2. Mount this volume into the file system of your application.
      Add it to the empty list of `volumeMounts` in the `container` section of your `deployment.yml`:

      ```yml title="volumeMounts:"
      - name: my-destination-service-binding-volume
        mountPath: '/etc/secrets/sapcp/destination/my-destination-service'
        readOnly: true
      ```

5. Update the configuration via `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`.

#### Bind the Identity and Authentication Service

1. Create a new `identity-service.yaml` file:

```yml title="identity-service.yaml"
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: my-identity-service
spec:
  serviceOfferingName: identity
  servicePlanName: application
  parameters:
    # Allowed redirect URIs in case you want to use an approuter behind an ingress for user login
    # oauth2-configuration:
    #  redirect-uris:
    #    - https://*.ingress.<your-cluster-host>/login/callback
    consumed-services: []
    xsuaa-cross-consumption: true
    multi-tenant: true
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: my-identity-service-binding
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: my-identity-service
  secretName: my-identity-service-secret
  secretKey: my-identity-service-key
```

2. Repeat the same steps 2-5 from the previous section, always replacing `destination` with `identity`.
