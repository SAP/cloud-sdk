[SAP Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) is a managed Kubernetes service by SAP developed as an Open Source project.
Essentially, Gardener is a thin layer of conventions on top of the plain Kubernetes.
It helps create and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters with less effort by abstracting environment specifics to deliver the same homogeneous Kubernetes-native DevOps experience everywhere.
