[SAP Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) is a managed Kubernetes service by SAP developed as an Open Source project.
In the nutshell Gardener is as close to the plain Kubernetes as it could be.
It allows creating and managing multiple Kubernetes clusters with less effort by abstracting environment specifics to deliver the same homogeneous Kubernetes-native DevOps experience everywhere.
