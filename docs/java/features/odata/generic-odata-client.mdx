:::danger Advanced! Use on your own discretion.

The API for generic OData client is not intended to be used by application developers unless absolutely required.
Its API is a subject to change and non-breaking changes are not guaranteed.

Please, make sure you know what you're doing and check if stable type-safe OData client API can solve you problem.

## Overview

Together with type-safe OData client, we provide a more generic and untyped OData client implementation to be used in **advanced** use-cases when the capabilities of typed OData client are not enough to achieve your development goals.
You can leverage generic untyped OData client for:

- Workarounds and quick fixes
- Trying out OData features that are not yet implemented in OData type-safe client.
- When flexibility is above safety and convenience
- Debugging and testing
- Building specific OData protocol based API yourself
- Integrating OData capabilities and awareness into your project

:::tip
The generic client is capable of both OData V2 and V4 protocols.
The client is made aware about which version to use in requests via a dedicated parameter.
:::

## Basic API Usage

### Creating Requests

Requests are represented by dedicated request classes for each operation.
For example to read a collection of entities use:

```java
StructuredQuery query = StructuredQuery.onEntity("A_Entity", ODataProtocol.V4);
new ODataRequestRead("/path/to/service", query);
```

:::tip
Queries can be created conveniently as described in [Building Queries below](#building-queries).
:::

**Other Operations:**

```txt
ODataRequestRead
ODataRequestReadByKey
ODataRequestCreate
ODataRequestUpdate
ODataRequestDelete
ODataRequestFunction
ODataRequestAction
```

:::note

What used to be function imports in OData V2 have been split into functions and actions in the OData V4 standard.
The above classes adopt the OData V4 notion.
To perform V2 function imports leverage the function class in case the operation should use HTTP GET.
If instead the operation should use POST, use the action class.

:::

### Evaluating Responses

Requests can be executed by supplying an HTTP client to the `execute` method.
You can obtain a client from any given destination as follows:

```java
final HttpClient client = HttpClientAccessor.getHttpClient(destination);
// perform the HTTP operation:
final ODataRequestResultGeneric result = request.execute(client);
```

Within `execute` the SAP Cloud SDK will perform a health check on the response.
In case of a status code greater or equal to 400 an exception will be thrown.

The result class allows for parsing the result into a specific Java type, getting metadata or even the raw HTTP response.
For example, you can parse the response body into a `SalesOrder` or a list of sales orders as follows:

```java
SalesOrder order = result.as(SalesOrder.class);
Collection<SalesOrder> order = result.asList(SalesOrder.class);
```

### Building Queries

Queries can be build with dedicated, fluent builder classes.
Use the `StructuredQuery` class to create a query:

```java
StructuredQuery query = StructuredQuery.onEntity("Movies", ODataProtocol.V4);
// method names correspond to the OData query parameters $select, $filter, etc.
query.select("Field A", "Field B");
// obtain the encoded URL string representation:
String encodedQuery = query.getEncodedQueryString();
```

For filters there is a dedicated API to build filter expressions:

```java
FieldUntyped fieldA = FieldReference.of("Field A")
FieldUntyped fieldB = FieldReference.of("Field B")

ValueBoolean expression = fieldA.equalTo("foo").and(fieldB.greaterThan(42));

// add the expression as filter to a query:
query.filter(expression);
```

## Handling OData Delta Token

[OData v4 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html#sec_RequestingChanges) provides capabilities to return only a delta between your last and ongoing request.
For example, if your previous request loaded information from the service which continues to be updated with new records, then with your next request you can ask to provide you only with the difference between what you've already loaded and current records on the service side.
For that, you can leverage `$deltatokens` query parameter.

We do not provide convenience API for delta tokens in our type-safe client, but you can leverage generic OData client to fetch the delta link from the `response` metadata and extract `$deltatoken` from there as in the code snippet below.

```java
// Fetching of a $deltatoken from response metadata
@Nullable
private static String getDeltaTokenFromResponse( @Nonnull final ODataRequestResultGeneric response) {
    try {
        final InputStream httpResponseContent = response.getHttpResponse().getEntity().getContent();
        final String deltaLink = new ObjectMapper().readTree(httpResponseContent).get("@odata.deltaLink").asText();
        final Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile("\\$deltatoken=(.*?)(&|$)").matcher(deltaLink);
        if (matcher.find()) {
            return matcher.group(1);
        }
        return null;
    }
    catch(Exception e) {
        // log exception with debug level
        return null;
    }
}

```

Now you can create an OData request leveraging the `$deltatoken` token you have just fetched.

```java
// Composing a delta request with generic OData client
ODataRequestResultGeneric response = request.execute(httpClient);
String deltaToken = getDeltaTokenFromResponse(response);
if( deltaToken!=null) {
    deltaRequest.addQueryParameter("$deltatoken", deltaToken);
}
```

## OData v2 Batch Read Request

Batch requests for OData v2 are not yet supported in the [type-safe client](./type-safe-client-odata-v2.mdx#batch-requests).
Let's look at how you can work around that with a generic OData client.

In the code snippet below we:

1. Prepare an instance of `HttpClient` that will be used to execute the HTTP request.
1. Initialize a generic OData Batch request with OData service path and protocol version.
1. Build a read request for an OData entity collection and add it to the Batch request object.
1. Execute the Batch request.
1. Access the Batch response and fetch the list of fields from OData entities, that matched the applied read request.

```java
HttpDestination destination;
String servicePath = "/sap/opu/odata/sap/<SERVICE_PATH>";
String entityName = "EntityCollectionName";
HttpClient httpClient = HttpClientAccessor.getHttpClient(destination);

// instantiate custom OData V2 batch request
ODataRequestBatch requestBatch = new ODataRequestBatch(servicePath, ODataProtocol.V2);

// instantiate custom OData V2 read request
StructuredQuery structuredQuery = StructuredQuery.onEntity(entityName, ODataProtocol.V2);
structuredQuery.select("Field1", "Field2", "Field3");
structuredQuery.filter(FieldReference.of("Field4").equalTo("FooBar"));
String encodedQuery = structuredQuery.getEncodedQueryString();
ODataRequestRead requestRead = new ODataRequestRead(servicePath, entityName, encodedQuery, ODataProtocol.V2);

// add read request to batch
requestBatch.addRead(requestRead);

// execute the batch request
ODataRequestResultMultipartGeneric batchResult = requestBatch.execute(httpClient);

// extract information from batch response, by referring to the individual OData request reference
ODataRequestResultGeneric queryResult = batchResult.getResult(requestRead);
List<Map<String, Object>> listOfEntityFields = queryResult.asListOfMaps();
```

This example is a great demonstration of how you can work around certain limitations of a type-safe client aka VDM, tackle advanced OData features, or even take care of misbehaving servers or OData standard deviations.

## Call OData v4 Bound Functions and Actions

Bound function and actions were freshly introduced in OData v4 specification.
We'll soon provide a type-safe API to leverage these features in a convenient way.
If you already require using this functionality, we have a low-level implementation in place that is capable of performing bound function and action calls.

Below is a generic client example that you can use as a workaround:

```java
// this code will build the following URL:
// "/service/Entity(key1='foo%2Fbar',key2=123)/Model.Function(param1='foo%2Fbar',param2=123)"

ODataEntityKey key = new ODataEntityKey(ODataProtocol.V4)
    .addKeyProperty("key1", "foo/bar")
    .addKeyProperty("key2", 123);

ODataFunctionParameters  params = new ODataFunctionParameters(ODataProtocol.V4)
    .addKeyProperty("param1", "foo/bar")
    .addKeyProperty("param2", 123);

ODataResourcePath functionPath =
    new ODataResourcePath()
        .addSegment("Entity", key)
        .addSegment("Model.Function", params);

ODataRequestFunction request =
    new ODataRequestFunction("/service", functionPath, null, ODataProtocol.V4);
```

This is essentially what happens under the hood when you are using the generated type-safe client code.
When we release a support for type-safe calls you can replace these snippets with the fluent API.

### Adding Trailing Slash to the Service Path

By default, the SAP Cloud SDK strips all trailing slashes from a resource path.
It's a standard behavior and works for 99% of productively available services.
Sometimes, however, services might complain or even fail if a path doesn't end with a slash `/`.

- `https://host/service-path/resource-path/?$filter...` - works
- `https://host/service-path/resource-path?$filter..` - doesn't work (default URI composition strategy in the SAP Cloud SDK)

To work around this situation you can use the generic OData client:

```java

ODataRequestRead request = new ODataRequestRead("/service-path/resource-path/", "", "$filter=...", ODataProtocol.V2)
// produces an URI like this: /service-path/resource-path/?$filter=...

HttpClient client = HttpClientAccessor.getHttpClient(destination);
ODataRequestResultGeneric result = request.execute(client);

```
