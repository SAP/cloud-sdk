title: Generic Advanced OData Client
sidebar_label: Generic OData Client
description: Together with type-safe OData client we provide a more generic and untyped OData client implementation to be used in advanced use-cases when the capabilities of typed OData client are not yet covering your use-case or fundamentally not enough to achieve your development goals. You can leverage untyped generic OData client for workarounds and trying out OData features that are not very frequently used. It's also helpful in a situation when flexibility is above safety and convenience.

## Handling OData Delta Token

[OData v4 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html#sec_RequestingChanges) provides capabilities to return only a delta between your last and ongoing request.
For example, if your previous request loaded information from the service which continues to be updated with new records, then with your next request you can ask to provide you only with the difference between what you've already loaded and current records on the service side.
For that, you can leverage `$deltatokens` query parameter.
We do not provide convenience API for delta tokens in our type-safe client, but you can leverage generic OData client to fetch the delta link from the `response` metadata and extract `$deltatoken` from there as in the code snippet below.

```java
// Fetching of a $deltatoken from response metadata
@Nullable
private static String getDeltaTokenFromResponse( @Nonnull final ODataRequestResultGeneric response) {
    try {
        final InputStream httpResponseContent = response.getHttpResponse().getEntity().getContent();
        final String deltaLink = new ObjectMapper().readTree(httpResponseContent).get("@odata.deltaLink").asText();
        final Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile("\\$deltatoken=(.*?)(&|$)").matcher(deltaLink);
        if (matcher.find()) {
            return matcher.group(1);
        }
        return null;
    }
    catch(Exception e) {
        // log exception with debug level
        return null;
    }
}

// Composing a delta request with generic OData client
ODataRequestResultGeneric response = request.execute(httpClient);
String deltaToken = getDeltaTokenFromResponse(response);
if( deltaToken!=null) {
    deltaRequest.addQueryParameter("$deltatoken", deltaToken);
}
```
