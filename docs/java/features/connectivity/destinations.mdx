The SAP Cloud SDK offers some basic functionality that helps with connecting to other systems and services like SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
The SAP Cloud SDK introduces the general concept of a `Destination` which holds basic information about how to connect to such a system.
That could for instance be a `url`, a user name, and password for basic authentication or some custom headers.

This concept is integrated with the [Destination Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/7e306250e08340f89d6c103e28840f30.html) that is available on the SAP Cloud Platform.
If the application has a service binding to this service in place the SAP Cloud SDK will provide access to these destinations.

## Accessing Destinations

In general destinations are accessed through the `DestinationAccessor`:

```java
DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");
```

This will look up the destination in the destination service if the application is running on SAP Cloud Platform.
Other sources like the environment variables are also considered.

## Supported Authentication Flows

We provide support for the following authentication types on Business Technology Platform - Cloud Foundry.

### Integrated Multi-Tenancy

By default, the `DestinationAccessor` is tenant aware.
If a tenant is available it will be used to access the destination service on behalf of that tenant.
If no destination is found in the tenant-specific destination service the SAP Cloud SDK will try to get it using the service binding of the application.

This default retrieval strategy can be overridden by passing options to the destination loader as follows:

```java
DestinationAccessor.getLoader().tryGetDestination(destinationName, options);
```

See the section on [destination options](#building-destination-options) below.

## Decorating Destinations

Depending on the use case, one needs to wrap the accessed destination before issuing a request to a system.
This is to make sure all required destination properties are correctly set before invoking the actual request.

### HTTP Destinations

In case of HTTP connections one needs to wrap the retrieved destination as `HttpDestination` using `asHttp()`:

```java
DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination").asHttp();
```

This method ensures that the required destination properties are all set to make the HTTP connection.
With the resulting destination instance depending on the use case one can run HTTP queries for ODATA or REST.

### BAPI Destinations

Similarly, for BAPI endpoints you need to use `asRfc()`:

```java
DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination").asRfc();
```

### Connect to SAP S/4HANA On-Premise

If your destination is exposing an SAP S/4HANA on-premise service via a **[Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html)** you need to decorate the destination with `DefaultErpHttpDestination`:

```java
final HttpDestination httpDestination =
destination.asHttp().decorate(DefaultErpHttpDestination::new);
```

This ensures the mapping of all SAP S/4HANA properties like `sap-client` and `sap-locale` as HTTP request headers.

## Registering Destinations at Runtime

The SAP Cloud SDK offers convenient ways to create a destination at runtime and register it so that it will be available via `DestinationAccessor.getDestination()`.
This is especially useful when working in a local environment.
Destinations configured in the destination service are not available in a local setting and have to be mocked.

### Mocking Destinations for Testing

The SAP Cloud SDK offers a `MockUtil` class that is capable of injecting destinations into the `DestinationAccessor`:

```java
final MockUtil mockUtil = new MockUtil();

MockDestination destination = MockDestination
            .builder("my-destination", URI.create("http://localhost:8080"))
            .build();

mockUtil.mockDestination(destination);

// This will now return the mocked destination
DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination").asHttp();
```

This helps with keeping production and test code nicely separated.
There are more overloads of the mocking on the [MockUtil class](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/testutil/MockUtil.html) that you can use.
Refer to [these tutorial steps](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/s4sdk-odata-service-cloud-foundry.html#b77d53b0-2d8b-449c-9a9a-9df80ee09a4e) on how to mock destinations for local development and testing.

### Using Custom Destination Loaders

The above is useful for testing but not suited for productive code.
If you want to register custom destinations in your productive code you can use the following API:

```java
customHttpDestination = DefaultHttpDestination.builder("http://url")
        .name("custom-destination")
        .build();

customLoader = new DefaultDestinationLoader()
        .registerDestination(customHttpDestination);

DestinationAccessor.appendDestinationLoader(loader);

// This will now return the custom destination
DestinationAccessor.getDestination("custom-destination").asHttp();
```

By default, the `DestinationAccessor` is using a `DestinationLoaderChain` that comprises multiple loaders.
These are e.g. a loader to get destinations from the destination service and a loader that reads destinations from environment variables.

The above `appendDestinationLoader()` will add the provided loader at the end of such a chain.
That means the new loader can operate as a fallback.
Use `prependDestinationLoader()` to add it at the beginning if you would like it to take precedence.
Lastly use `setLoader()` to replace all existing loaders.

## Provide Headers for Destinations

### How It Works

You can add headers that are sent for any request over destinations.
You can implement custom logic that defines which headers are sent under which circumstances.

:::note Example Use-case
Let's imagine, you want to send an API token via a request header with any calls made over any destination in your whole application.
:::

The SAP Cloud SDK offers the interface `DestinationHeaderProvider` which defines the method `List<Header> getHeaders(DestinationRequestContext)`.
At runtime, while preparing an outbound request, the SAP Cloud SDK will use all implementations of that interface which have been registered via the Java ServiceLoader mechanism (see below).
For each registered implementation it invokes the method `getHeaders(DestinationRequestContext)` and appends the returned headers to the currently prepared request.

### Implement Own Header Provider

#### Implement the Interface **DestinationHeaderProvider**

To implement your custom destination header provider, you need to implement the interface `DestinationHeaderProvider`.
The method `getHeaders` provides access to the request specific context.
The method argument of type `DestinationRequestContext` lets you access the general properties over which the currently prepared request will be issued.
Depending on your logic to determine headers, you can read the following data types:

- `DestinationProperties getDestination()` (e.g. the general destination name).
- `URI getRequestUri()` (e.g. the request specific query parameters)

Here is one simple example implementation which returns the same header for each request:

```java
@Nonnull
@Override
public List<Header> getHeaders( @Nonnull final DestinationRequestContext requestContext )
{
  final Header header = new Header("API-Token", obtainApiToken());

  return Collections.singletonList(header);
}
```

#### Make Interface Implementation Accessible

The SAP Cloud SDK uses the [Service Loader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html) mechanism of Java to lookup the `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementations at runtime.
To let your custom implementation be found, you need to provide a configuration file as resource in the folder `META-INF/services`.
Name this resource file as the interface `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationHeaderProvider` and mention the fully-qualified class name of your custom implementation.
You can refer to several implementations by putting their fully qualified class names on separate lines.
Place the file in your resources folder, that is for a regular Maven project the file path `src/main/resources/`.

For example, if your custom implementation is named `ApiTokenHeaderProvider` in the package `com.example`, the content would be:

```
com.example.ApiTokenHeaderProvider
```

## Retrieving Destinations

### Get All Destinations From the Destination Service on Cloud Foundry

To fetch all destinations from the Destination Service, you need to make a call to `tryGetAllDestinations`.
The method queries the [Destination Service API](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_CF_Connectivity_Destination/overview) and retrieves all the destinations available at the service instance and sub-account level.
In case there is a destination available on both the levels with the same name, then this method prioritizes the destination at the service instance level.

Below is the sample call to `tryGetAllDestinations`:

```java
final Try<Iterable<ScpCfDestination>> destinations = destinationLoader.tryGetAllDestinations(options);
```

In the above call `destinationLoader` needs to be an instance of `ScpCfDestinationLoader`.

#### Configuring Timeout Durations When Querying the Destination Service on Cloud Foundry

By default, the [TimeLimiter resilience pattern](/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/resilience/resilience#resilience-capabilities) aborts requests to the Destination Service on Cloud Foundry after 6 seconds.
If your app requires more time when fetching destinations, you may create your own `ScpCfDestinationLoader` instance by:

```java
// Allow requests to take up to 10 seconds instead of just 6
final DestinationLoader destinationLoader = new ScpCfDestinationLoader(Duration.ofSecond(10));
```

This operation overrides the default timeout duration so that you are free to choose whatever value fits your needs.

:::note Hint

You may register your `destinationLoader` within the `DestinationAccessor` by:

```java
DestinationAccessor.setLoader(destinationLoader);
```

That way, all future requests to the Destination Service will use the increased timeout duration.

:::

#### Building Destination Options

You need to build a `DestinationOptions` object and pass it as a parameter.
It defines how Destinations Service is queried.
In a simple application without provider/subscriber setup, your initial configuration is as simple as:

```java
final DestinationOptions options = DestinationOptions.builder().build();
```

For a provider/subscriber setup, a [retrieval strategy](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ScpCfDestinationRetrievalStrategy.html) must be chosen according to your particular use case from:

- `ALWAYS_SUBSCRIBER` (default)
- `ALWAYS_PROVIDER`
- `SUBSCRIBER_THEN_PROVIDER`.

Here is an example for `SUBSCRIBER_THEN_PROVIDER` option:

```java
final DestinationOptions options =
          DestinationOptions
              .builder()
              .augmentBuilder(
                  ScpCfDestinationOptionsAugmenter.augmenter().retrievalStrategy(
                      ScpCfDestinationRetrievalStrategy.SUBSCRIBER_THEN_PROVIDER))
              .build();
```

You can similarly use other retrieval options.

## Configure HTTP Destinations for Local Deployment

When testing your app on localhost instead of SCP you require some configuration steps to make the destination retrieval work.

:::note HTTP Destinations
This section refers to the maintenance of HTTP destinations.
Refer to the documentation about [BAPI/RFC communication](../bapi-and-rfc/overview.mdx) concerning the maintenance of RFC destinations for local deployment.
:::

:::note Works for SAP Business Application Studio too
The configuration procedures outlined here work too when you launch your app "locally" inside SAP Business Application Studio.
It does not matter that the app does not run on your own machine.
:::

To better understand the configuration steps, we'll outline shortly how destination retrieval works when running your app on SCP.
Thereafter we'll outline the configuration procedures in detail.

### Background: Destination Retrieval on SAP Cloud Platform

By default the SAP Cloud SDK uses a set of so-called destination loaders in a given order when searching for a destination via the `DestinationAccessor` API:

```java
DestinationAccessor.tryGetDestination("MyDestination");
```

#### Environment Variable

The first destination loader attempts to find the requested destination in the environment variable `destinations`.
Here is an example value:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "HTTP",
    "name": "MyDestination",
    "proxyType": "Internet",
    "description": "This destination rocks!",
    "authentication": "BasicAuthentication",
    "url": "https://URL",
    "user": "USER",
    "password": "PASSWORD"
  }
]
```

:::tip Multiple Destinations
You can configure multiple destinations with that approach.
Note that the value of the environment variable is a JSON array, so you can add further entries into it.
:::

#### SAP Cloud Platform Destination Service

If the previous lookup was not successful, the next destination loaders examine the environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES` to see if the SCP destination service is bound.
If so, the SAP Cloud SDK queries the SCP destination service for the destination configuration per the requested destination name.

#### SAP Cloud Platform Connectivity Service

In case the destination is of proxy type `OnPremise`, the SAP Cloud SDK performs an additional query to the SCP connectivity service to obtain further proxy information and an authorization token.

### Configuration Procedure for Localhost

#### Destinations With Proxy Type "Internet"

Maintain the destination configuration via the environment variable `destinations`.
See the example value above for reference.

#### Destinations With Proxy Type "OnPremise"

We have to some perform configuration steps to tell the SAP Cloud SDK how to access the SCP destination service and connectivity service.

:::note Are your client and server located on the same Network?
If your localhost (client) resides in the same network zone as the target system (server) you can access it directly.
Configuration of SCP connectivity services is not needed.
All you have to do is creating a destination via environment variable `destinations`.
:::

##### Maintain VCAP_SERVICES

How to create the `VCAP_SERVICES` representation depends on whether the Cloud Application Programming (CAP) Model is used.

<Tabs groupId="isCapUsed" defaultValue="true" values={[ { label: 'CAP is used', value: 'true', }, { label: 'CAP is not used', value: 'false', }]}>

<TabItem value="false">

Create the `VCAP_SERVIES` environment variable on the shell or operating system level.
Copy the value of that environment variable from your app which is deployed to SCP.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value ="true">

Create the file `default-env.json` in your project's root and supply the `VCAP_SERVICES` value you copied beforehand so that the file looks similar to the following shortened example:

```json
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "connectivity": [
      {
        "label": "connectivity",
        "plan": "lite",
        "name": "my-connectivity",
        "instance_name": "my-connectivity",
        "credentials": {
          ...
        }
      }
    ],
    "xsuaa": [
      {
        "label": "xsuaa",
        "plan": "space",
        "name": "my-xsuaa",
        "instance_name": "my-xsuaa",
        "credentials": {
          ...
        }
      }
    ],
    "destination": [
      {
        "label": "destination",
        "plan": "lite",
        "name": "my-destination",
        "instance_name": "my-destination",
        "credentials": {
          ...
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}


```

Furthermore, add the dependency `com.sap.cds:cds-integration-cloud-sdk` to your POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
  <artifactId>cds-integration-cloud-sdk</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Skip Destination Creation Step for Certain Authentication Types on Cloud Foundry

For certain authentication types i.e. `NoAuthentication` and `OAuth2ClientCredentials` there is an API that eliminates the need to manually create a destination in the CF account for connecting to services.

Example:

```java
final Map<String, String> mapping =
      ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.buildClientCredentialsMapping(
        "credentials.endpoints.service_rest_url",
        "credentials.uaa.clientid",
        "credentials.uaa.clientsecret",
        "credentials.endpoints.token_url");
```

`ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.buildClientCredentialsMapping` creates a mapping for loading a destination and provides JSON paths for all required destination properties.

```java
final HttpDestination destination =
      ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.getDestinationForService(
        "label",
        "serviceBindingName",
        AuthenticationType.OAUTH2_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS,
        mapping);
```

For certain services (only BTP Workflow service for now), we provide further convenience that skips the need to provide the `mapping` explicitly.
Example:

```java
final HttpDestination destination =
      ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.getDestinationForService(
        ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.CfServices.WORKFLOW,
        "my-workflow");
```

##### Enable Access to SAP Cloud Platform Connectivity Service

The SCP connectivity service builds the connection between SCP and the on-premise network.
That is why it has strong built-in restrictions to allow it only to be called from within SCP.
If you would call the connectivity service from your local machine, you would encounter a connection timeout.
We'll therefore apply port forwarding via SSH to simulate that your localhost plays the cloud app.

- Deploy your app to the SCP once.
- Enable SSH access to your app container with the `cf` CLI:

```bash
cf enable-ssh app-name
cf restart app-name
````

- Inspect the value of the entry `connectivity` of your `VCAP_SERVICES` and take note of the values of the fields
  - `credentials.onpremise_proxy_port`
  - `credentials.onpremise_proxy_host`

:::note
We'll refer to these values as _proxy-port_ and _proxy-host_ hereafter.
:::

- Create an SSH session to your app container with the following command and let the session opened:

```bash
cf ssh app-name -L proxy-port:proxy-host:proxy-port
```

- Replace the value of the field `VCAP_SERVICES.connectivity.credentials.onpremise_proxy_host` in your `default-env.json`
  with `localhost`.

:::success Ready
Now your local setup is ready to consume an on-premise HTTP destination.
:::
