The SAP Cloud SDK now supports certificate based authentication while establishing connections to other cloud services.
:::info
Currently being limited to `XSUAA`, support exists but is not tested extensively yet for `Destination` and `Connectivity` services.

## Why mTLS
Mutual `TLS` or `mTLS` for short is a method for mutual authentication.
It ensures that before proceeding with the `HTTP` exchange both the client and the server each mutually verify each other's identities by the use of `X.509` certificates.

## Authentication with JWT and shortcomings
Previously, when a service or an application is protected using [`XSUAA`](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6373bb7a96114d619bfdfdc6f505d1b9.html), we need to obtain an access token from `XSUAA` to access the service or application.
To obtain an access token or `JWT`, first we extract the `clientid`, `clientsecret` and `uri` from the environment variable of the service binding and then using the `url` from `xsuaa` service binding, trigger a [`token flow`](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/main/token-client) to obtain a `JWT`.
Now, adding this obtained `JWT` as an `Authorisation` header to the request to the service, ensures that your request gets authorised and authenticated.

However there is always the inherent risk that these credentials may get leaked. These credentials are typically not frequently changed as well.
With the use of certificates the risk of leaking powerful technical user credentials can be mitigated.

## Certificate based Authentication (Soon to be default)
To adhere to the latest recommended security best practices by SAP, some re-use and kernel services have enabled certificate based authentication.
As a consequence, SAP Cloud SDK also supports certificate based authentication while accessing these services.

:::info
SAP Cloud SDK currently only supports XSUAA managed certificates.
