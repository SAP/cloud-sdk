:::danger

Currently, support for Certificate-based Authentication from SAP Cloud SDK is fully end-to-end tested only with the `XSUAA` service.
`Destination` and `Connectivity` services should also work but are not yet fully tested.

:::

The SAP Cloud SDK supports certificate-based authentication while establishing connections to other cloud services like `XSUAA` or `Destination` service.

## Why Certificate-based Authentication (mTLS)

Mutual `TLS` or `mTLS` for short is a method for mutual authentication.
It ensures that before proceeding with the `HTTP` exchange both the client and the server each mutually verify each other's identities by the use of `X.509` certificates.
Using Certificate-based authentication ensures that we overcome the shortcomings of authenticating with client credentials.

## Shortcomings of Client Credentials

Let's take an example of a service or an application protected by [`XSUAA`](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6373bb7a96114d619bfdfdc6f505d1b9.html).
To access the service or application, you'll need a `JWT`.
You will usually fetch a `JWT` by providing `clientid`, `clientsecret` and `uri` stored in your service bindings to run a [`token retrieval flow`](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/main/token-client)

The use of `client credentials` has an inherent risk of these credentials being leaked, especially as they are not frequently rotated.
Leaking the credentials of a technical user into the hands of an attacker can cause a lot of harm and stay long unnoticed.
The use of certificate-based authentication to fetch the JWT-token from the `XSUAA` significantly reduces the risk of leaking secrets and makes rotating them easier.

:::note

The SAP Cloud SDK automatically fetches the `JWT` for you.
Application developers do not need to worry about doing it themselves.
We automatically add fetched `JWT` to the `Authorization` header when requesting a service to ensures that the request gets authenticated and authorized.

:::

## Certificate-based Authentication for Services

To adhere to the latest recommended security best practices by SAP, some re-use and kernel services have enabled certificate-based authentication.
As a consequence, SAP Cloud SDK also supports certificate-based authentication while accessing these services.
If a service binding has a property `credentials: { credential-type: x509 }` then this is an indication that you can use certificate-based authentication to access the service.

`XSUAA` service is one of the services that has enabled certificate-based authentication.
This means that in the service binding in addition to the `client_secret` you will also find `certificate` and `key` entries now.
Example:

```
{
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
		"xsuaa": [
			{
				"label": "xsuaa",
				...
				"credentials": {
				    ...
				    "credential-type": "x509"
					"clientid": "fictional-client-id",
					"clientsecret": "fictional-secret",
					"certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----fictional-certificate-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
					"key": "key"
					...
				},
			}
		]
	}
}
```

This certificate would now be used to establish a secure session to obtain the `JWT` instead of the client credentials token flow used previously.
The SAP Cloud SDK will as before fetch the `JWT` for you.
The only difference is that the `certificate` from your service binding is used to authenticate the client.

## Default Validity Period of Certificates

The `X.509` certificates used in the service binding could either be external or `XSUAA` managed.
By default `XSUAA` managed certificates are valid only for **7 days**.
Your calls to the `XSUAA` to fetch a `JWT` will fail after your certificate expires.

:::warn certificate renewal process

To obtain a new certificate, you'll have to delete and re-create a service binding.
The application also needs to be restarted to use the updated service binding.

:::

### Extending the Validity of a Certificate

For less frequent certificate rotation you can extend its validity to a maximum of 1 year.
For the `XSUAA` managed certificate use parameters below when creating a service binding.

`cf bind-service myapp myservice -c parameters.json`

```json
{
  "credential-type": "x509",
  "x509": {
    "key-length": 2048,
    "validity": 365,
    "validity-type": "DAYS"
  }
}
```

:::note

With longer certificate validity there's a danger that compromised certificate might go unnoticed for a significant period of time.
This significantly increases potential damage to a compromised system.

:::

## Sticking to Client Credentials

If you prefer to continue using **Client Credentials** instead of **Certificate-based Authentication**, make sure your `xs-security.json` contains the `instance-secret` as the first entry in the property `credential-types`.

```json
"oauth2-configuration": {
  "credential-types": ["instance-secret"]
}
```
