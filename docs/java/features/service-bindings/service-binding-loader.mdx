### Load Service Binding Information

SAP Cloud SDK provides functionality to load service binding information when running the application in any Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes (in particular Gardener) environment.
Below you can find an architectural overview of the relevant classes.
:::note Experimental API

Please note that the API is currently in an experimental state.

Let's look at the classes and their use cases individually.

#### ServiceBindingLoader

This interface offers only one method to load the existing service bindings for the current application.
The abstract method named `load()` will have different functionality based on the subclass.
The following four classes implement this interface.

#### FileSystemServiceBindingLoader

![FileSystemServiceBindingLoader](/img/FSSBL.png 'FileSystemServiceBindingLoader')

This class is used for transforming file system structures (e.g. files and directories) into service bindings, starting at a specific root location based on the provided `ParsingStrategy`.
It has a _Functional Interface_ (`ParsingStrategy`), exposing the `Map<String, JsonArray> parse(Path)` method.
`FileSystemServiceBindingLoader.ParsingStrategy` represents an algorithm to transform a given root location (the directory in the file system) to service bindings.
`FileSystemServiceBindingLoader` takes the root location path and a `ParsingStrategy`.
The SAP Cloud SDK offers several implementations for the `ParsingStrategy` as shown in the figure.

#### EnvironmentVariableServiceBindingLoader

![EnvironmentVariableServiceBindingLoader](/img/EVSBL.png 'EnvironmentVariableServiceBindingLoader')

This class is used for transforming environment variables into service bindings based on the provided `ParsingStrategy`.
It has a _Functional Interface_ (`ParsingStrategy`), exposing the `Map<String, JsonArray> parse(Function<String, String>)` method.
`EnvironmentVariableServiceBindingLoader.ParsingStrategy` represents an algorithm to transform environment variables that can be obtained from the given environment variable reader into service bindings.
`EnvironmentVariableServiceBindingLoader` takes an environment variable reader and a `ParsingStrategy`.
The SAP Cloud SDK offers an implementation for the `ParsingStrategy` as shown in the figure.

#### ServiceBindingMerger

![ServiceBindingMerger](/img/SBM.png 'ServiceBindingMerger')

This class is used for merging the result of an arbitrary amount of given instances based on the provided `MergingStrategy`.
It has a _Functional Interface_ (`MergingStrategy`), exposing the `Map<String, JsonArray> merge(List<Map<String, JsonArray>> serviceBindingsCollection)` method.
`ServiceBindingMerger.MergingStrategy` represents an algorithm to merge multiple service bindings.
`ServiceBindingMerger` is capable of merging the result of multiple loaders on a binding name (it assumes that each service binding has a property called name) level.
With that, it is able to combine multiple service bindings for the same service from different sources.
SAP Cloud SDK offers an implementation for the `MergingStrategy` as shown in the figure.

#### SimpleCachingServiceBindingLoaderWrapper

![SimpleCachingServiceBindingLoaderWrapper](/img/SCSBLW.png 'SimpleCachingServiceBindingLoaderWrapper')

This class is used for wrapping another instance and caching the result for a certain amount of time.
Once the cache duration has been exceeded, the wrapped `ServiceBindingLoader` is evaluated again.
The cache can also be reset in a manual fashion.

#### Usage

The SAP Cloud SDK features can be used in a Kubernetes environment without additional configuration (specifically `ScpCfCloudPlatform`).
You can load the service binding information by calling the `Map<String, JsonArray> getVcapServices()` method.
This method enables you to utilize the described architecture without additional configuration.
By default, the service bindings are loaded in the following order:

- Service Operator (Kubernetes) Secret Root Key layout
- Service Operator (Kubernetes) Secret Key layout
- Service Operator (Kubernetes) Data (Default) layout
- VCAP_SERVICES environment variable

This can be customized by providing a `ServiceBindingLoader` with the method `setServiceBindingLoader(ServiceBindingLoader)`.
The root directory for file system based loaders can be customized by using the method `setServiceBindingsRootLocation(Path)`.
