The current approach of Enterprise Messaging in the SAP Cloud SDK for Java relies on a library developed by SAP Cloud Application Model.
Follow the official documentation on the [CAP Messaging API for Event Consumption](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/) for further reference.

:::note

The type-safe client for SAP S/4HANA Enterprise Messaging from SAP Cloud SDK for Java is deprecated.
From now on the library from CAP is a default way for message consumption.
