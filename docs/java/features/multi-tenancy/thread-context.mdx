## What Is a Thread Context?

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java provides a so-called `ThreadContext`.
It serves as thread-safe storage for potentially sensitive information.
Specifically, the following three objects are stored:

- The current _Tenant_
- The current _Principal_ (User)
- The [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io) (JWT)

This information is used throughout the SAP Cloud SDK to provide features like tenant and principal isolation, JWT verification and authorization against other systems and services.
To ensure different tenants and users are properly isolated in an application, this information is always limited to the thread it was created on unless it is explicitly passed on by the application (see [Propagating the Thread Context](#running-asynchronous-operations)).

:::info
The term _Tenant_ is a concept used by the XSUAA Service on SAP BTP.
In that context a Tenant has a 1:1 relationship to the subaccount a multi tenant application is subscribed in.

An extension of this is the _Zone_ concept, used by the IAS Service on SAP BTP.
Here you can group multiple subaccounts into a single zone.

On side of the multi tenant application this doesn't make a difference.
That is why the SAP Cloud SDK for Java uses the term _Tenant_ in both cases.

## How Is a Thread Context Created?

The SAP Cloud SDK provides a [`RequestFilter`](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/servlet/RequestAccessorFilter.html) that will listen to incoming HTTP requests.
If the `Authorization` header contains a `JWT` from the [`AppRouter`](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/03/sap-application-router/), the filter will:

- Verify this token
- Store it in the `ThreadContext` and
- Pull the _Tenant_ and _Principal_ information from it

## How Can the Thread Context Be Used?

### Accessing Information

The Thread context can be accessed via the static [`ThreadContextAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/thread/ThreadContextAccessor.html).

For the frequently needed _Tenant_, _Principal_ and _JWT_ there are also dedicated accessors:

- [`TenantAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/tenant/TenantAccessor.html)
- [`PrincipalAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/principal/PrincipalAccessor.html)
- [`AuthTokenAccessor`](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/security/AuthTokenAccessor.html)

### Storing Information

The [`ThreadContext`](https://help.sap.com/doc/b579bf8578954412aea2b458e8452201/1.0/en-US/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/thread/ThreadContext.html) allows for some manipulation by the application.
However, oftentimes it is more convenient to leverage the `executeWith...()` functionality offered by the dedicated accessors.

Consider a scenario where some part of the code should run on behalf of a specific tenant.
In that case you can override the current tenant explicitly:

```java
TenantAccessor.executeWithTenant(customTenant, () -> doStuff());
```

:::caution
Be aware, that the `executeWith` methods shown above only replaces the given property, but does not update properties derived from it.

Example: You have a special `AuthToken`, that you propagate with `AuthTokenAccessor.executeWithAuthToken`.
Inside the given code block only the `AuthToken` will be replaced, while e.g. the `Tenant` is the same as in the original context.

If you want to start a fresh context based on a given `AuthToken`, for example accessing information of the provider tenant while in a subscriber context, have a look at this code:

```java

Tenant retrieveProviderTenant()
{
    // retrieves an access token from the provider context
    AuthToken providerXsuaaAccessToken = AuthTokenAccessor.getXsuaaServiceToken();
    return new ThreadContextExecutor()
        // don't reuse the original context
        .withoutParentThreadContext()
        // add the provider token into the new context
        .withListeners(new AuthTokenThreadContextListener(providerXsuaaAccessToken))
        // return the actual provider tenant
        .execute(TenantAccessor::getCurrentTenant);
}

```

:::

### Running Asynchronous Operations

As the name suggests the `ThreadContext` is bound to a thread, more specifically to the one it was created.
If asynchronous operations need to access the information, it has to be propagated to the new threads.

The following code achieves this:

```java
ThreadContextExecutor executor = new ThreadContextExecutor();
Callable operationWithContext = () -> executor.execute(() -> operation());

invokeAsynchronously(operationWithContext);
```

Take note that the `ThreadContextExecutor` is created _before_ performing the asynchronous operation.
This is important because only at that time the context is available and will be propagated.

A similar approach can be applied with the `Tenant`, `Principal` and `AuthToken` accessors.
This code runs an asynchronous operation with a dedicated tenant:

```java
Callable operationWithTenant = TenantAccessor.executeWithTenant(customTenant, () -> operation());

invokeAsynchronously(operationWithContext);
```

:::danger Thread Lifecycle

Be cautious with long-running, asynchronous operations.
A propagated thread context will only persist as long as the thread lives that it was created on.
So when the parent thread dies the context will cease to exist and no longer be available in any of the threads.
