## What Are Extensions?

By providing versatile and reliable core functionality to aid modern cloud development SAP Cloud SDK also becomes an important integration layer for various SAP technologies.
To leverage this and benefit developers using the SAP Cloud SDK, we accept contributions from libraries and services coherent with the SAP Cloud SDK's mission and value proposition.

### How Extension Different From Other Features?

We make sure extension libraries are well integrated into the SAP Cloud SDK's ecosystem and call them extensions to make it clear they are not the core SAP Cloud SDK components.
It doesn't make the features introduced by them less valuable for a developer.
These extensions are usually shipped in separate packages similar to libraries generated from API definitions.

### Extension vs Type-Safe API Client Library?

Usually, with an extension, you get more than a nice API client but also a hand-crafted code specific to needs that go beyond calling and API.

## Where Can I Find Supported Extensions?
