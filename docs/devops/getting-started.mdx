### Deprecation

The SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery and its features have been merged into [project "Piper"](../related-projects/piper.mdx).
We recommend using the [General Purpose Pipeline of project "Piper"](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/stages/introduction/) instead of the SAP Cloud SDK pipeline.
The reasoning for this change, as well as further information on how to adopt the General Purpose Pipeline, are described in this [guide](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/blob/master/gpp-guide.md).
