:::note
There's no full feature parity between Java and JavaScript/Typescript SDKs. This is intentional and on purpose because often they'd target slightly different use-cases that justifies discrepancies.

## Pre-generated type-safe client libraries for S/4HANA

:::tip Different packaging strategy between SDKs
- SDK for Java has separate maven modules for S/4HANA Cloud & S/4HANA On-premise. Those are in turn split into modules containing OData v2 and OData v4 services. We also ship an aggregating module if you want to add all the S/4HANA client libraries to you dependencies. A Java `Class` represents one OData service in S/4HANA.
- SDK for JavaScript/Typescript ships one client library NPM package per S/4HANA service. Packages for S/4HANA Cloud always contain the latest APIs. Packages for S/4HANA On-Premise have `-op-` in their name and contain all the versions of respective service's APIs where the latest version exported as default. A `Class` here represents an `Entity` in `OData` terms, while package represents a service. SDK for JS/TS doesn't ship any aggregator packages.
