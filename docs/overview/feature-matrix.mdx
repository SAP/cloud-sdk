:::note
There's no full feature parity between the SAP Cloud SDK for Java and the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript.
This is intentional because often they'd target slightly different use-cases that justify differences.

## Pregenerated Type-Safe Client Libraries for SAP S/4HANA

:::tip Different packaging strategy

<!-- vale SAP.Products = NO -->

- SAP Cloud SDK for Java has separate maven modules for SAP S/4HANA Cloud & SAP S/4HANA On-premise.
  Those are in turn split into modules containing OData v2 and OData v4 services.
  We also ship an aggregating module if you want to add all the SAP S/4HANA client libraries to your dependencies.
  A Java `Class` represents one OData service in SAP S/4HANA.
- SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript ships one client library npm package per SAP S/4HANA service.
  Packages for SAP S/4HANA Cloud always contain the latest APIs.
  Packages for SAP S/4HANA On-Premise have `-op-` in their name and contain all the versions of respective service's APIs where the latest version exported as default.
  A `Class` represents an `Entity` in `OData` terms, while each package represents a service.
  The SAP Cloud SDK for JS/TS doesn't ship any aggregator packages.
