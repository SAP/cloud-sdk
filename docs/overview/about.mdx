## Introduction

The SAP Cloud SDK is a versatile set of libraries and tools for developers to easily build applications in a cloud-native way and host them on SAP Cloud Platform or other runtimes.

### Benefits & Capabilities

The SAP Cloud SDK is available for [Java](../java/getting-started.mdx) and [JavaScript/Typescript](../js/getting-started.mdx) providing the following benefits and capabilities:

- A set of pre-generated type-safe client libraries for various SAP published OData and REST services for convenient consumption and bullet-proof developer experience.
- Robust connectivity abstractions for SAP Cloud Platform for convenient management of Destinations, Authentication, Multi-tenancy, CSRF, E-tags, and more.
- A tailor-made type-safe client code generator for OData services that seamlessly integrates with other SDK value-adds.
- A type-safe client code generator for REST services that wraps the open-source generator with custom code templates to make it deeply integrated with other SDK features.
- An easy to use CLI with code scaffolding capabilities.
- A [pre-configured CI/CD pipeline](../related-projects/piper.mdx) to set you on the best DevOps practices from the get going.
- Modular design and high-level of extensibility
- Advanced cloud-native development patterns like resilience, caching, inherent multi-tenancy, etc.
- Support in [Business Application Studio](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html)
- First class documentation and [support](../overview/support.mdx)

### Well-integrated with the SAP cloud development ecosystem

The SAP Cloud SDK is well-integrated with other SAP products and services like:

- Cloud Application Programming model is also known as [CAP](../related-projects/cap.mdx)
- [S/4HANA Cloud, and On-Premise ERPs](https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana-erp.html)
- [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/)
- [SuccessFactors](https://www.sap.com/products/human-resources-hcm.html)
- [SAP Cloud for Customers](https://www.sap.com/products/sales-cloud.html) - C4C
- [Feildglass](https://www.fieldglass.com/)
- [Concur](https://www.concur.com/)
- [Ariba](https://www.ariba.com/)
- [SAP Cloud Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform.html)
- Deploy with Confidence
- ...
- In the next chapter you'll learn how to generate a type-safe client for any SAP service and entertain benefits of the Cloud SDK

### Your own SDK

Thanks to code generator capabilities, the SDK is compatible almost with any other product that can be the one you develop.

It gives a lot of advantages and instant access to the SAP Cloud ecosystem for developers building Apps or Extensions for SAP products or integrating them with other products and solutions.

For more details, check out our [Feature matrix](./feature-matrix.mdx) and [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) guides for both SDKs.

### Open Source

The SAP Cloud SDK actively works in the direction of open-sourcing most of its components. We strive to be an active player in the Open Source community by endorsing open standards and technologies to simplify the developer's life and stay ahead of the curve. The SAP Cloud SDK for [JavaScript/Typescript](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js) is already Open Source which allows developers easily access our source code, integrate SDK in their Apps, and contribute back into SDK to improve it.

We're remaining main contributors to every SDK component and continue actively developing them to ensure the highest quality and seamless integration with other SAP solutions.
