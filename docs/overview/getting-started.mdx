## Create Your First App

You can choose between `JavaScript` and `Java` when developing with the SAP Cloud SDK.
Check these two examples to initialize an application for your favorite development environment.

<Tabs
defaultValue="js"
values={[
{ label: 'JavaScript', value: 'js', },
{ label: 'Java', value: 'java', },
]}>

<TabItem value="js">

:::note Prerequisites
Make sure you have the latest stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and `npm` installed.
This example assumes you're running macOS or Linux.
Check out our detailed [getting started guide](../js/getting-started.mdx) for more information.

```bash
$ npm install -g @sap-cloud-sdk/cli

$ sap-cloud-sdk init my-sdk-project

| ðŸš€ Next steps:                                                |
| - Run the application locally (`npm run start:dev`)           |
| - Deploy your application (`npm run deploy`)                  |
|                                                               |
| ðŸ”¨ Consider setting up Jenkins to continuously build your app |
| Use `sap-cloud-sdk add-cx-server` to create the setup script  |

## Hello, World!

This example is not a classical `Hello World`.
There is much more to it than just bootstrapping a starter application.
The SAP Cloud SDK is a complex and flexible library addressing a vast range of use-cases.
Each of them would require a `Hello World` of its own, and we have them!

To continue discovering the SAP Cloud SDK for your favorite programming language check the respective getting started guides and comprehensive tutorials for multiple use cases.

:::note
There is no full feature parity between JavaScript and Java libraries.
Please, review the respective documentation sections to find out more.

### Mock and Test Servers for OData and SAP S/4HANA

- We created a [service](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/MA/book-bupa-mock-odata) that mocks SAP S/4HANA Business Partner service. You can host it on your own machine to practice with the SAP Cloud SDK.
- [TripPin reference service](https://services.odata.org/V4/TripPinServiceRW) used in official OData v4 documentation to provide [tutorials and learning materials](https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/).
- [Northwind reference service](https://services.odata.org/V4/OData/) has a complex data model allowing to try out advanced OData v4 features with the SAP Cloud SDK.
