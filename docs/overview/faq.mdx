:::

## What Programming Languages Can I Use?

You can code in [Java](../java/getting-started.mdx) or [JavaScript](../js/getting-started.mdx).

## How Was the SAP Cloud SDK Started?

We've been and still are developing cloud-native applications in the SAP ecosystem.
After some time, we've noticed that many useful patterns repeat themselves, and we abstracted them for reuse.
Our colleagues showed interest in our work because of solving similar problems with their applications.
That's when we decided to wrap that value into a library and make it available for SAP developers and later to SAP customers for benefiting from our experience of building from scratch and extending SAP applications.

## SAP Cloud SDK & [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](../related-projects/cap.mdx)? What is the difference?

Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and SAP Cloud SDK are complementary tools to publish and consume APIs like OData and REST.
They play nicely together to cover the full stack of cloud-native application development.
The SAP CAP plays more on the API and service publishing side, while SAP Cloud SDK deals more with API consumption and deployment of applications to SAP Business Technology Platform.

You can use the SAP Cloud SDK and CAP together in one project.
Find more details about CAP [here](../related-projects/cap.mdx) and check out our [tutorial about using SAP Cloud SDK for Java and CAP together](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cloudsdk-integrate-cap.html).

## Can I Run an SAP Cloud SDK App Locally

Yes, you can.
Check respective documentation for [Java](../java/getting-started.mdx) and [JavaScript](../js/getting-started.mdx#run-the-project).
If you experience any issues, let us know via our support channels.

## Is It Expensive?

The SAP Cloud SDK is free for everyone.
Parts of it are available as [open source software](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js).
Other parts containing SAP Intellectual Property are distributed free of charge under the [SAP Developer License](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3.0.0.txt).

## How Often Do You Release a New Version?

We release bi-weekly on average.
You can find release notes for Java and JavaScript in their respective documentation sections.
Some packages or modules like pregenerated type-safe client libraries are released according to the release-cycle of the underlying service.
They can be updated if we made a change to the code generator between the releases.
