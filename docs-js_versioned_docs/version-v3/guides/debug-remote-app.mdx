This guides outlines the steps you need to follow to start a remote debugging session from your IDE for an application that is already deployed on Cloud Foundry in SAP BTP.

## Assign yourself as a Space Developer

:::note
You need to have the Space Manager or Org Manager role.
For details see [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/81d0b4dcfbc84016b6b3c1465d4272f4.html).
:::

- Open the [SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/) and navigate to your subaccount
- Go to the space on Cloud Foundry where your application will be pushed to
- Click _Member_ on the left side menu
- Add yourself as a _Space Developer_

## Deploy Your Application with Debug Mode

In the package.json file, replace the `start` script to run in debug mode.
E.g., instead of `node start.js` for node, use:

```shell
node --inspect start.js
```

And instead of `ts-node start.ts`, use:

```shell
node -r ts-node/register --inspect start.ts
```

You can do this by either changing your start script in the package.json or the command script in the `manifest.yml`.

:::note
Don't use `--inspect-brk`, this will make the `start` timeout on SAP Business Technology Platform.
:::

Deploy your application as usual by running the command:

```shell
cf deploy
```

## Open an ssh Tunnel to Your Application

Open an [ssh tunnel](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html#ssh-command) to your backend application to connect your local debugger with the node inspector running on port 9229.
Replace `<your-app-name>` with your application name and run:

```shell
$ cf ssh <your-app-name> -L 9229:127.0.0.1:9229 -T -N
```

## Attach a Local Debugger

Now you can attach your local debugger.
For this you will have to launch a debugger that attaches to the remote session.

### Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, you can use the below attach configuration for Node.js debugging.
Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION_PATH` with the relative path to your application directory:

```JSON
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach to Remote",
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 9229,
      "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/YOUR_APPLICATION_PATH",
      "remoteRoot": "/home/vcap/app",
      "skipFiles": ["node_modules/**"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Webstorm

In Webstorm you can add configure debugging by creating a config as shown below:

<!-- vale off -->

<ThemedImage
  alt="Application Router flow"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('img/remote-debugging-config-webstorm.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('img/remote-debugging-config-webstorm.png')
  }}
  className="center"
  width="80%"
/>

<!-- vale on -->

Start the debugger !
