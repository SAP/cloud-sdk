By default, when you execute a batch request, the subrequests are serialized to a multipart representation of the request, which is essentially a string.
This is what a create request for a business partner addresses would serialize to:

```
Content-Type: application/http
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

POST /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartnerAddress HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{"BusinessPartner":"1","PostalCode":"10001","City":"New York","Country":"USA"}

```

The first lines are request headers for the multipart request, followed by a blank line.
The next line contains the request method and URL, followed by the request headers, a blank line, and the request payload.
Every "atomic" request is serialized to a string of this kind, while `GET` and `DELETE` requests do not provide a payload.
