The SAP Cloud SDK provides a configuration with recommended [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules and plugins.
It extends the `eslint:recommended` and `@typescript-eslint/recommended` configurations.
It also uses the `eslint-config-prettier` to avoid any formatting conflicts when using the highly recommended [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Install the `@sap-cloud-sdk/eslint-config` package in your project.
To add the configuration please adjust your ESLint configuration (usually called `.eslintrc` or `.eslintrc.js`):

```
{
  "extends": "@sap-cloud-sdk"
}
```

or if you want to combine this configuration with others:

```
{
  "extends": ["example-config", "@sap-cloud-sdk"]
}
```

This configuration depends on plugins `eslint-plugin-import` and `eslint-plugin-unused-imports`, which need to be installed in your project.

ESLint merges these shareable configurations with your configuration.
Any rule configured in your `.eslintrc.js` will overwrite the setting for this rule in the shareable configuration.
