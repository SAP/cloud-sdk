# Using the SAP Application Router with the SAP Cloud SDK

In this guide, we will show you how to use the SAP Application Router together with the SAP Cloud SDK.
You will learn how to secure your application and configure multi-tenancy for principal propagation with an SAP Cloud SDK-based application example powered by [nestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

## SAP Application Router

When we want to enable multi-tenancy for our application, we use the [SAP Application Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter).
The application router's primary purpose is to be the single entry point of a microservice-based application and act as the application's reverse proxy.

Its responsibilities consist of dispatching requests to backend microservices, authenticating users, and serving static content.
The application router checks if a given request has a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) when accessing a target service.
If the request contains a valid JWT, the application router forwards the request to the target service; if the request does not contain a valid JWT, the user must authenticate.
As we can see in the diagram below, we use an Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate, the request is redirected to an IdP where a user gets authenticated and then redirected back to the application router for passing further according to its desired destination.

### Application Router Setup

To deploy our application router in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry, we need to configure it first.
Let's walk through the four files we need to use.

The `xs-security.json` file defines the security and deployment options for an application.
With the below example, we enable the `shared` tenant-mode for our `xsuaa` instance, which we need for multi-tenancy.

```json
{
  "xsappname": "approuter-scaffold",
  "tenant-mode": "shared"
}
```

In the `xs-app.json`, we specify to which backend service a request is forwarded to, and how this request has to be authenticated.
We can optionally also specify a specific `identityProvider` that is used for the authentication.

In the example below, we forward every request against the application router's `/` route to the backend destination's `/` route.

```json
{
  "welcomeFile": "index.html",
  "routes": [
    {
      "source": "/",
      "target": "/",
      "destination": "approuter-scaffold"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the `package.json` we only have one dependency, the application router module.

```json
{
  "name": "approuter",
  "dependencies": {
    "@sap/approuter": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/@sap/approuter/approuter.js"
  }
}
```

The manifest contains our application router, as well as environment variables which our application router needs for multi-tenancy.
As you see under `env`, we specify the `TENANT_HOST_PATTERN` and `destinations`.
The `destinations` are the destinations we use in our `xs-app.json` where we forward requests to.
The `TENANT_HOST_PATTERN` is a regular expression that describes how a tenant name should be retrieved from the host.
We also have to bind the `xsuaa` which we configured with our `xs-security.json` to the application router.

```yaml
applications:
  - name: approuter-scaffold-approuter
    routes:
      - route: >-
          approuter-scaffold-apps.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
    path: .
    memory: 128M
    buildpacks:
      - nodejs_buildpack
    env:
      TENANT_HOST_PATTERN: >-
        "approuter-scaffold-(.*).cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
      destinations: >-
        [{"name":"approuter-scaffold","url":"approuter-scaffold.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com","forwardAuthToken":true}]
    services:
      - approuter-scaffold-xsuaa
```

## Securing Your Application

To secure our application endpoints, we utilize the [passport](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt) library.
It lets us authenticate endpoints using a JSON web token.

Additionally, we use the `xsenv` library to retrieve our `xsuaa` credentials and the `xssec` library's `JWTStrategy` object for the middleware.

Below is a simple example, where we get the `approuter-scaffold-xsuaa` which is bound to our application, use it in the `JWTStrategy`, and then forward the middleware to the passport.

<!-- vale off -->

```ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { JWTStrategy } from '@sap/xssec';
import { getServices } from '@sap/xsenv';
import * as passport from 'passport';

const xsuaa = getServices({
  xsuaa: { name: 'approuter-scaffold-xsuaa' }
}).xsuaa;
passport.use(new JWTStrategy(xsuaa));

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.use(passport.initialize());
  app.use(passport.authenticate('JWT', { session: false }));
  await app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

## Enabling Principal Propagation

To enable principal propagation with this setup, we must forward the request to our endpoints.

First, we forward the request in our `app.controller.ts` to our principal propagation endpoint.

```ts
@Get('principal-business-partner')
  getPrincipalBusinessPartner(
    @Req() request: Request,
  ): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
    return this.principalBusinessPartnerService.getFiveBusinessPartners(
      request,
    );
  }
```

Then, we simply use the SAP Cloud SDK's `retrieveJwt` function to extract the JWT from our request, and forward it to the `execute` method.

Below is an example using the `BusinessPartnerService`, where we retrieve the top five business partners.

<!-- vale off -->

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { retrieveJwt } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/connectivity';
import { Request } from 'express';
import { businessPartnerService } from './generated/business-partner-service';

@Injectable()
export class PrincipalBusinessPartnerService {
  async getFiveBusinessPartners(request: Request): Promise<BusinessPartner[]> {
    return BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
      .getAll()
      .top(5)
      .execute({
        destinationName: 'MY-DESTINATION',
        jwt: retrieveJwt(request)
      });
  }
}
```
