This documentation describes how you can send e-mails from applications deployed on the SAP BTP to your e-mail servers.
When defining e-mail servers by using the `destination` service on the SAP BTP, both `Internet` and `On-Prem` destinations are supported.

## Installation

Run this command in your root directory of your project to install the `mail-client` dependency and add it to your `dependency` list:

```
npm install @sap-cloud-sdk/mail-client
```

## Examples

In this section you find minimal examples illustrating how to send e-mails using the SAP Cloud SDK.

### Send an E-Mail

First, create a `mailConfig` that contains all the essential information of an e-mail:

<!-- vale off -->

```ts
import { sendMail, MailConfig } from '@sap-cloud-sdk/mail-client';

const mailConfig: MailConfig = {
  from: 'from@example.com',
  to: 'to@example.com',
  subject: 'e-mail subject',
  text: 'e-mail text'
};
```

<!-- vale on -->

You send the e-mail by calling `sendMail` with your `mailConfig` as argument:

```ts
sendMail({ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }, [mailConfig]);
```

The first parameter is either a [destination](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/2.9.0/interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.Destination) object or [DestinationFetchOptions](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/2.9.0/interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.DestinationFetchOptions).
For productive environment, you should use the `destination service` on the SAP BTP and reference the destination by name just like the example above.
`{ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }` is the minimal object that is typed as `DestinationFetchOptions`.
For test environment, instead of using the `DestinationFetchOptions`, you can also pass a complete `destination` object.

:::caution Caution

As the destination object might contain credentials, using it in production should be avoided.

:::

You can read more about the abstraction of the `destination` in the documentation [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/js/features/connectivity/destination).

### Send Multiple E-Mails

The code snippets below shows how to send two e-mails with the `mailConfig` that you created in the previous example.
The e-mails are sent in parallel by default.

```ts
sendMail({ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }, [mailConfig, mailConfig]);
```

#### Send E-Mails in Sequential

Sometimes you prefer sending e-mail in sequential instead of in parallel due to e.g., the rate limit of your e-mail server.
To send e-mails in sequential, set the `parallel` option to `false`:

```ts
sendMail({ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }, [mailConfig, mailConfig], {
  sdkOptions: {
    parallel: false
  }
});
```

:::tip

As the parallelization is the default behaviour, you don't have to set `parallel: true` explicitly.

:::

### Configure `nodemailer`

The SAP Cloud SDK uses the node package `nodemailer` under the wood.
`nodemailer` supports creating a `transport` based on options listed in their [documentation](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/).
The SAP Cloud SDK exposes these options (as `SmtpTransportOptions`) and will transfer them based on user input.
For example, you can provide the `tls` option like below to circumvent issues with self-signed certificates:

```ts
sendMail({ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }, [mailConfig], {
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
```

The SAP Cloud SDK API documentation of the complete `SmtpTransportOptions` can be found in the API doc [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/api/2.9.0/interfaces/mailclient_src.SmtpTransportOptions).

#### Proxy

`nodemailer` also supports defining proxy option as mentioned [here](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/proxies/).
Similar to other `nodemailer` options, the `proxy` key is also part of the `SmtpTransportOptions`.
You can find a minimal example below for defining an HTTP proxy:

```ts
sendMail({ destinationName: 'my-mail-destination' }, [mailConfig], {
  proxy: 'http://my-proxy-host:1234'
});
```

Using socks proxy is not supported for the time being.
For on-premise connectivity via the connectivity service on the SAP BTP, please check the next section.

:::caution

The SAP Cloud SDK will pass the proxy option directly to the `nodemailer`, but the proxy feature is not end-to-end tested.

:::

## On-Premise Destination

The SAP Cloud SDK supports using `On-Premise` destination as well.
From the SAP Cloud SDK API perspective, the code looks similar, no matter you use `On-Premise` destinations or `Internet` destinations.
The only difference is that you have to reference the name of the On-Premise destination, which is obvious.

### What's the Difference

First, for applications deployed on the SAP BTP, you need a `connectivity` service for connecting to an `On-Premise` destination.
Second, a `Cloud Connector` is used as a proxy for accessing the `On-Premise` system.
Please make sure the mail destination is configured correctly as discussed in the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/8d1f989deca1455dabc3d81b433fbdaf.html).

### `SOCKS5` Proxy Implementation

Using a `SOCKS5` proxy for accessing on-premise systems from applications on SAP BTP requires the `SOCKS5` authentication flow as explained [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/cd1583775afa43f0bb9ec69d9dbcc880.html?locale=en-US).
The SAP Cloud SDK handles the `SOCKS5` proxy implementation automatically when detecting an `On-Premise` mail destination.

:::tip

For some on-premise e-mail server, including our test server, the parallelization of sending email might be a challenge.
You can disable the parallelization by passing `parallel: false` as mentioned before.
