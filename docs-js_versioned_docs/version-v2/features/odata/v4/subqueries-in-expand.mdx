Note that you can create very complex queries within the expand scope:

```ts
const { peopleApi } = peopleService();
peopleApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getAll()
  .expand(
    peopleApi.schema.FRIENDS.select(
      peopleApi.schema.FIRST_NAME,
      peopleApi.schema.ADDRESS_INFO
    )
      .filter(peopleApi.schema.LAST_NAME.equals('Miller'))
      .orderBy(asc(peopleApi.schema.GENDER))
      .top(1)
      .skip(1)
  );
```

In this example, the filter will reduce the number of friends to be shown.
The effect of a filter depends on whether it is used inside or outside an `expand`.
The different cases are explained in [Filters in Expand.](#filterParentChildren)

The URL for the query will be:

```sql
/People?$expand=Friends($select=FirstName,AddressInfo;$filter=(LastName eq 'Miller');$skip=1;$top=1;$orderby=Gender asc)
```
