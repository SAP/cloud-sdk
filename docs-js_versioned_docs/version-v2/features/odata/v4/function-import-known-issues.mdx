1. Currently, the `Entity Type` is not supported to be used as the parameters of the operation.
   Operations with such unsupported parameters are ignored during the generation.
   This feature will be implemented in the future.
   Please check this [issue](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/707) and comment if you need this feature.
