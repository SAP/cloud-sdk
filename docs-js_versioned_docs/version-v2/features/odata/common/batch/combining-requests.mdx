You can combine requests within a `batch` request as you like.
In the example below, you combine create requests, update requests, and get requests into one `batch` request.
Remember, that change requests have to be wrapped in a `changeset`.
Put the create requests into one changeset and combine the update and delete requests into another.
The `GET` requests are added to the `batch` request directly without wrapping.

Once the batch request is executed the response will be an array of sub-responses to the specific changeset and retrieve requests in the order that was given in the request.
Note, that the sub-responses of a [changeset](#changeset) don't have to be in order.

```ts
async function executeComplexBatch(
  createAddressRequests: CreateRequestBuilder<BusinessPartnerAddress>[],
  updateAddressRequests: UpdateRequestBuilder<BusinessPartnerAddress>[],
  deleteAddressRequests: DeleteRequestBuilder<BusinessPartnerAddress>[],
  getAddressByIdRequests: GetByKeyRequestBuilder<BusinessPartnerAddress>[]
) {
  // Execute batch request
  const [
    createAddressesResponse,
    updateAndDeleteAddressesResponse,
    ...getAddressesByIdResponses
  ] = await batch(
    changeset(...createAddressRequests),
    changeset(...updateAddressRequests, ...deleteAddressRequests),
    ...getAddressByIdRequests
  ).execute(destination);

  // Do something with responses
}
```
