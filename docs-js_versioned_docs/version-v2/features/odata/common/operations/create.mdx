The `CreateRequestBuilder` class allows you to send a `POST` request to create an entity:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi } = businessPartnerService();
const businessPartner = businessPartnerApi.entityBuilder().build();
businessPartnerApi.requestBuilder().create(businessPartner);
```

In the example above you created an instance of `BusinessPartner` and sent it to the `BusinessPartner` service in a `POST` request.
