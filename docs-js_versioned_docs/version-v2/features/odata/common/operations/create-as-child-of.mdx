Assume you have already created a business partner and would like to add an address to it:

```ts
const { businessPartnerApi, businessPartnerAddressApi } =
  businessPartnerService();
const existingBusinessPartner = await businessPartnerApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .getByKey(myID)
  .execute(myDestination);

const newAddress = businessPartnerAddressApi
  .entityBuilder()
  .country('DE')
  .postalCode('14469')
  .cityName('Potsdam')
  .streetName('Konrad-Zuse-Ring')
  .houseNumber('10')
  .build();
```

This can be done by using the `asChildOf` method which allows for creating an entity as a child of an existing entity.
You need to give the parent object and the field connecting the two entities:

```ts
businessPartnerAddressApi
  .requestBuilder()
  .create(newAddress)
  .asChildOf(
    existingBusinessPartner,
    businessPartnerApi.schema.TO_BUSINESS_PARTNER_ADDRESS
  )
  .execute(myDestination);
```
