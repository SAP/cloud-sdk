## Switch To the Open Source Version

Some packages of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript have been migrated to [github.com](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js).
As a result, the packages were renamed as shown in the table below.
No Breaking changes were made.
Please use the new packages from now on.

| old package name           | new package name           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `@sap/cloud-sdk-util`      | `@sap-cloud-sdk/util`      |
| `@sap/cloud-sdk-analytics` | `@sap-cloud-sdk/analytics` |
| `@sap/cloud-sdk-core`      | `@sap-cloud-sdk/core`      |
| `@sap/cloud-sdk-generator` | `@sap-cloud-sdk/generator` |
| `@sap/cloud-sdk-test-util` | `@sap-cloud-sdk/test-util` |

This mapping applies to the move to open source version 1.X.Y..
Since version 2.0.0, the `core` package has been split into smaller packages and the `analytics` package has been removed.
We recommend first migrating to version 1.52.0 of the open-source version.
Once this is done, follow the [upgrade guide](upgrade-to-version-2.mdx) to do the transition to version 2.0.0.

##### How To Use the Open Source Version

1.  Search for all your `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` in your `package.json`.
1.  Replace the old package name e.g., `@sap/cloud-sdk-core` with the new one e.g.`@sap-cloud-sdk/core`.
1.  Use a stable version of the SAP Cloud SDK e.g., `^1.18.0`.
1.  Delete your `node_modules` and the `package-lock.json`.
1.  Install your dependencies, run: `npm i`.
1.  Search your source code for references to the old packages (e.g. in import statements) and replace them with the new names.
