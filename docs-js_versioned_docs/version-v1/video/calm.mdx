Want to learn how you can create a [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](/docs/overview/overview-cloud-sdk#sap-cloud-application-programming-model) service and consume it using the SAP Cloud SDK?
The demo by the colleagues from SAP Cloud Application Lifecycle Management (CALM) explains how you can:

- Create a locally hosted CAP service
- Run API calls against the service using a typed client by SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript

This demo will familiarize you with the main concepts of developing cloud extensions with SAP Cloud SDK and CAP.
