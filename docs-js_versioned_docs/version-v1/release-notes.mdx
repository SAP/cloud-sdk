## Should I Update?

We highly recommend updating to the latest SAP Cloud SDK version regularly.

It will help you:

- Ensure access to the latest SAP Cloud SDK features
- Keep up with the latest changes on SAP Business Technology Platform
- Update client libraries giving access to the latest SAP services on SAP Business Technology Platform and SAP S/4HANA.
- Protect yourself from bugs and breaking changes in the future

:::tip What are pregenerated typed client libraries (VDM)?

These libraries are free (but not open-source) and distributed under the SAP Developer license through [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap%2Fcloud-sdk-vdm-*).
You can generate a typed client library yourself by using our [OData generator](features/odata/generate-odata-client.mdx) and [Open API](features/openapi/generate-openapi-client.mdx).
To easily search for services and get typed client library for them, use our [API Business Hub integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/17/the-sap-cloud-sdk-integrates-with-the-sap-api-business-hub/).

# 2.6.0 [Core Modules] - July 15, 2022

## Compatibility Notes

- [odata-v4, temporal-de-serializers] Adjust parsing of `Edm.Date`, `Edm.DateTimeOffset`, `Edm.Time`, and `Edm.Duration` to be closer to the OData v4 specification.
  There may be loss of precision if using the default (de-)serializers with high-precision fractional seconds. (de851289)
- [generator] Deprecate generator option `versionInPackageJson`. If you need to set the version, use the new `include` option to add your own `package.json` file instead. (069aa168)
- [generator] The hidden generator option `additionalFiles` is renamed to `include`. (069aa168)
- [connectivity] Rename `transformationFn` into `serviceBindingTransformFn` in `DestinationForServiceBindingsOptions` to avoid ambiguity and make the function async. (8fdfebd6)

## New Functionalities

- [connectivity] Support JWTs without a `JKU` property. (cb598c16)
- [connectivity] Add interface `DestinationCacheInterface` and method `setDestinationCache` to support implementation of custom destination cache. (09094607)
- [connectivity] Fetch client credential token for destinations created by service bindings. (93d41281)
- [generator] New generator option `include` which allows to add files to generated packages. (069aa168)

## Improvements

- [http-client] Make `requestConfig` of `OriginOptions` optional. (e46bb51d)

## Fixed Issues

- [connectivity] Fix `getDestination()` to allow passing an async transform function `serviceBindingTransformFn` in `options`. The transform function can also be passed by `execute()`, `executeHttpRequest()`, `executeRaw()`, etc.
- [http-client] Fix the `executeHttpRequest`/`executeHttpRequestWithOrigin` function, so the warning is only shown when overwriting headers by using custom headers. (e44c214a)
- [odata-common, odata-v4, temporal-de-serializers] Fix parsing of `Edm.DateTimeOffset` with high-precision fractional seconds and edge-cases like 5-digit years. (de851289)
- [odata-common, generator] Allow OData service to contain an entity name 'entity'. (0675ee3b)
- [odata-v2] Support negative epoch timestamps in serialization. (9ffe0824)

## 2.1.0 [Client Libraries] - Jul 5, 2022

### New Functionality

- **We released a regular update for pregenerated client libraries (also known as VDM) for the [latest SAP S/4HANA OnPremise release 2021 FPS2](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/09/sap-s-4hana-2021-feature-pack-stack-2-fps02/).**
  - The update covers all the changes to existing OData services, but does not introduce new ones.

### Compatibility Notes

- Reduce the exposed API to avoid confusion. Some internal APIs were exposed in previous versions. Those should not be used and would lead to erroneous behavior.

# 2.5.0 [Core Modules] - June 13, 2022

## Compatibility Notes

- [odata-common, generator] Change `Edm.String`, `Edm.Boolean` and `Edm.Guid` to be orderable to support `lt`/`lessThan()`, `le`/`lessOrEqual()`, `gt`/`greaterThan()`, and `ge`/`greaterOrEqual` operators. Re-generate odata services to adopt the changes. (c3166ff6)
- [util] Stop using `VCAP_SERVICES` to determine the log format. Use `setLogFormat` and `setGlobalLogFormat` to specify the log format. By default, the log format is set to `kibana` for `NODE_ENV=production` and `local` otherwise. (89f1c423)

## Fixed Issues

- [http-client] Fix the `executeHttpRequest` function, so it accepts the same parameters as in version 1.
  [Compatibility Note] Deprecate one overload of the `executeHttpRequest` function, that accepts `HttpRequestConfigWithOrigin` as a parameter. Use the new function `executeHttpRequestWithOrigin` as replacement.
  [New Functionality] Support defining header options and query parameter options with origins. (9481ec69)

# 2.4.0 [Core Modules] - May 20, 2022

## Compatibility Notes

- [connectivity] Mark the function `noDestinationErrorMessage` as internal API.
- [odata-v4] Mark the function `uriConverter` as internal API.
- [eslint-config] Switch the following `jsdoc` related levels from `warn` to `error`:
  - `jsdoc/check-param-names`
  - `jsdoc/require-description-complete-sentence`
  - `jsdoc/require-jsdoc`
  - `jsdoc/require-param`
  - `jsdoc/require-returns`
- [connectivity, http-client] Only log the successful retrieval of destinations on the `info` log level, log everything else as `debug` or `warn`.

## New Functionality

- [connectivity] Support self-signed certificate using the `trustStore` property of the destination object.

## Improvements

- [connectivity, http-client] Reduce default log output on the `info` level significantly.

## Fixed Issues

- [util] Fix a bug in the implementation of the trim method.

## 2.3.0 [Core Modules] - Apr 22, 2022

## Compatibility Notes

- [odata-common, odata-v2, odata-v4] Remove all `$format=json` query parameters since header `Accept: application/json` is sent by default.

## New Functionality

- [odata-common] Generate mandatory `Content-Id` headers for changeset parts in batch request payloads (see [OData Spec](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html#sec_MultipartBatchRequestBody)).
- [odata-common] Support transforming response data for function and action imports before deserialization. [#682](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/682).

## Improvements

- [generator] Change log level from `warn` to `error` if service path cannot be determined from the service specification (`VALUE_IS_UNDEFINED`).
- [generator] Reduce memory usage of `schema` in API classes (e.g., `BusinessPartnerAPI`).

## Fixed Issues

- [openapi-generator, openapi] Support path parameters that are not separated by '/', e.g., `/path/{param}:{param}`.

## 2.2.0 [Core Modules] - Apr 6, 2022

### Compatibility Notes

- [eslint-config] Replace `valid-jsdoc` with `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` plugin for checking JSDoc comments, since the `valid-jsdoc` rule is deprecated in ESLint.
  To stop your project from using a specific rule, turn it off by setting the rule ID to `off` under the `rules` key inside your configuration file.
- [generator] Stop exporting service classes (e.g., `BusinessPartnerService`) from generated clients, use `businessPartnerService()` instead.
- [generator] Stop exporting API classes (e.g., `BusinessPartnerAPI`) from generated clients, use `businessPartnerService().businessPartnerApi` instead.

### New Functionality

- [http-client] Introduce the `parameterEncoder` option to the request configuration of the `http-client` to allow custom parameter encoding.
- [http-client] Remove `method` from `defaultDisallowedKeys` to not filter out custom http method when using `filterCustomRequestConfig`.
- [odata-common] Support adding custom http method in `addCustomRequestConfiguration` to overwrite the default http method.
- [openapi] Support adding custom http method in `addCustomRequestConfiguration` to overwrite the default http method.

### Improvements

- [generator] Remove unused imports (e.g, `moment`, `bignumber.js` and `EdmTypeField`) in API classes (e.g., `BusinessPartnerAPI`) to reduce memory usage.
- [http-client] Introduce consistent query parameter encoding for all non custom parameters.

## 2.1.0 [Core Modules] - Feb 18, 2022

### Improvements

- [connectivity] Add details to error message for missing "URL" properties in destinations.
- [util] Add `sanitizeRecord` function to `cloud-sdk-logger` which replaces potentially sensitive information in a `Record<string, any>` based on a list of sensitive keys.
- [generator] The new CLI option `licenceInPackageJson` offers the possibility to specify the license property in a generated `package.json`.

### Fixed Issues

- [openapi-generator] Add `@sap-cloud-sdk/openapi` as a dependency to the OpenAPI generator to fix errors during generation with `--transpile` enabled.
- [connectivity] Fix an issue when using registering destinations with a JWT but without XSUAA service binding.
- [connectivity] Fix a missing export `DestinationSelectionStrategies`.
- [odata-common] Fix URL encoding for `getByKey`

## 1.54.1 [Core Modules] - Feb 18, 2022

## [CLI] - Jan 5, 2022

[GitHub](https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-sdk-cli) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-cloud-sdk/cli)

- Archive the GitHub repository.
- Deprecate the npm package.

## [Sample Projects] - Jan 5, 2022

[GitHub](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-sdk-js)

## 1.53.0 [Core Modules] - December 9, 2021

[GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/releases/tag/v1.53.0) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap-cloud-sdk)

### Fixed Issues

- Fix destination retrieval in multi-tenant use cases and user based authorization flows like `OAuth2UserTokenExchange`, `OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion` or `OAuth2JWTBearer`.
  If the destination is maintained in the provider account and a subscriber JWT is provided the `X-user-token` is set with the subscriber JWT.
  This is crucial to determine the tenant, if the `tokenServiceUrlType` of the destination is [common](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e3c333f9de6245fca326993f2397c13a.html).
- Fix missing X-tenant header, if the authentication flow is `OAuth2ClientCredentials` and the `tokenServiceUrlType` of the destination is [common](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/4e1d742a3d45472d83b411e141729795.html).

## 1.28.2 [Client Libraries] - November 17, 2021

### Compatibility Notes

- We stopped generating API documentation for typed client libraries.
  You can discover all required API information via your IDE features like autocomplete and IntelliSense.

### New Functionality

- **We released a regular update for pregenerated client libraries (also known as VDM) for the [latest RTC release 2111 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud](https://news.sap.com/2021/10/sap-s4hana-cloud-2111-innovating-business-futures/).**
  - The update covers all the changes to existing OData services and introduces new ones.
- **We released a regular update for pregenerated client libraries (also known as VDM) for the latest RTC release 2021 FPS0 of SAP S/4HANA On-premise.**
  - The update covers all the changes to existing OData services and introduces new ones.
- **We released a regular update for pregenerated client libraries for [Workflow API for Cloud Foundry](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_CF/resource).**

## 1.52.0 [Core Modules] - November 5, 2021

[GitHub](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/releases/tag/v1.52.0) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40sap-cloud-sdk)

### Compatibility Notes

- We changed default cache isolation strategy from `IsolationStrategy.Tenant` to `IsolationStrategy.Tenant_User`.
  This applies when you set `useCache` to `true` while using a `getDestination` method for a destination lookup.

### Fixed Issues

- We now cache a destination only when a `JWT` contains all necessary information about a `Tenant` and a `User`.
  For example, when using `IsolationStrategy.Tenant_User`, the JWT has to contain both **tenant id** and **user id**.
- If `JWT` has an expiration time, we'll use it to override the default cache expiration time of 5 minutes.
- A **provider** token won't be used to retrieve a destination from cache from now on.

## 1.27.0 [Client Libraries] - Aug 20, 2021
