## OpenAPI & the SAP Cloud SDK

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard is a popular format to define RESTful APIs.
Together with [OData](../odata/overview.mdx) OpenAPI is one of the key API definition formats used at SAP.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient tooling to make the consumption of OpenAPI services easy and convenient on SAP Business Technology Platform.

### OpenAPI Code Generator

We developed an [OpenAPI code generator](generate-openapi-client.mdx) from the ground up.
It's a [command line tool (CLI)](generate-openapi-client.mdx#options-of-the-openapi-cli) capable of converting any OpenAPI specification into a TypeScript or JavaScript type-safe client library that is seamlessly integrated with other SAP Cloud SDK features like:

- [connectivity](../connectivity/destination.mdx)
- multi-tenancy
- authentication
- destinations
- and other abstractions of the SAP Business Technology Platform.

We support both OpenAPI versions **2.0** and **3.0**.
You can use the OpenAPI generator to create a client library for any OpenAPI-based API service available on the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/) or found elsewhere in the Internet.
If you encounter any problems or errors with OpenAPI tooling give us feedback via our [support channels](/docs/overview/get-support).

### Pregenerated OpenAPI Type-safe Client Libraries

We're collaborating with service publishers at SAP to certify and release type-safe OpenAPI client libraries for their services on npm.
The [SAP Workflow service](pregenerated-clients/workflow.mdx) is a good example of such collaboration.
Stay tuned for more certified services.
Stay tuned for more OpenAPI client libraries certified by the SAP Cloud SDK or create a [request](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/issues) for the specific service you're interested in.

:::tip generate a client library yourself

You can always [generate an OpenAPI client library yourself](generate-openapi-client.mdx) based on API specifications available on the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/) or found elsewhere.
