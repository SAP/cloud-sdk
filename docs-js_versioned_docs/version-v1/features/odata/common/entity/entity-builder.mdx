To build an entity by assigning its properties, you can use the entity builders provided by every entity class.
Use the static `.builder` method to access the builder, set the properties and finally use the `.build` method to yield the entity.
To set navigation properties, that link to other entities, you have to create the linked entities using their respective builder.
Navigation properties, that are linked through a one-to-many relation have to be assigned in an array - one-to-one relations are assigned as single objects.
The example below shows how you can create the data from above using the entity builder.
The relation to the business partner address is a one-to-many relation here.

```ts
import {
  BusinessPartner,
  BusinessPartnerAddress
} from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

const businessPartner = BusinessPartner.builder()
  .firstName('Peter')
  .lastName('Pan')
  .toBusinessPartnerAddress([
    BusinessPartnerAddress.builder().country('Neverland').build()
  ])
  .build();
```

You can also add fields, that are unknown according to the specification, if you add them as custom fields.
To achieve this, pass an object the `.withCustomFields` method, where the keys denote the names of the custom fields, and the values their respective values.

```ts
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

const businessPartner = BusinessPartner.builder()
  .firstName('Peter')
  .withCustomFields({
    myCustomField: 'this is custom'
  })
  .build();
```
