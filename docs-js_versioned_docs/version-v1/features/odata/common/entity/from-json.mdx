Sometimes, it makes sense for you to store your data as a JSON object, that is based on the entity type.
For example, when using the property names of the entity class as properties of your object.
If you are looking for a way to create an entity from a JSON response, that you got from an OData service, you are probably looking for [entity deserialization](#deserialize-an-odata-json-response-to-an-entity).

This would be the JSON representation of a business partner in the SAP Cloud SDK:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Peter",
  "lastName": "Pan",
  "toBusinessPartnerAddress": [
    {
      "country": "Neverland"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use this data to build an entity using the `.fromJson` method.
The example below shows how you would create an instance of the business partner class using the `.fromJson` method.

```ts
import { BusinessPartner } from '@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-business-partner-service';

const businessPartner = BusinessPartner.builder().fromJson({
  firstName: 'Peter',
  lastName: 'Pan',
  toBusinessPartnerAddress: [
    {
      country: 'Neverland'
    }
  ]
});
```

If there are unknown fields present in the JSON object, they will be treated as custom fields.
