The update request builder allows you to change existing entities.
By default, `PATCH` is used to only update changed fields.

In the following example, we first get a business partner, change one of its values, and then send an update request.

```ts
// Get a business partner
const businessPartner = await BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .getByKey('1')
  .execute({ destinationName: 'myDestination' });

// Change first name
businessPartner.firstName = 'Steve';

// Send a PATCH request with `{ "FirstName" : "Steve" }`
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().update(businessPartner);
```

In the example above we changed the first name of the given business partner.
The payload sent to the service with PATCH includes only the first name.

Be aware that update requests will fail if their ETags don't match.
