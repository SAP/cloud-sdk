The Delete request builder allows you to create `DELETE` requests, that delete an entity.

```ts
/*
  The following won't work on the real SAP S/4HANA BusinessPartner service because BusinessPartners cannot be deleted.
  We added this only for the sake of the example.
*/
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder().delete(businessPartner);
```

Be aware that delete requests will fail if their ETag doesn't match.
Check out our [ETag](#handling-of-etags) section for more information.
