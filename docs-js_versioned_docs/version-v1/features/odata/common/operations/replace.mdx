To replace an entity instead of just updating specific fields, use `replaceWholeEntityWithPut`:

```ts
BusinessPartner.requestBuilder()
  .update(businessPartner)
  .replaceWholeEntityWithPut();
```

This will send a `PUT` request and include all existing properties on your entity, whether they were changed or not.
