A retrieve request represents an HTTP `GET` request.
In terms of the SAP Cloud SDK this includes all requests built by [`GetAllRequestBuilder`](#getall-request-builder) and [`GetByKeyRequestBuilder`](#getbykey-request-builder).

You can pass retrieve requests directly to the `batch` function.
Once you execute a `batch` request you get a list of [`BatchResponse`](#responses).
A `BatchResponse` that corresponds with a retrieve request can either be a `ReadResponse` or an `ErrorResponse`.

In the example below, we map each given address ID to a [`GetByKeyRequestBuilder`](#getbykey-request-builder).
These retrieve requests are combined into one `batch` request and executed against a destination.

```ts
async function getAddressesByIds(
  businessPartnerId: string,
  addressIds: string[]
): Promise<BusinessPartnerAddress[]> {
  const retrieveRequests = addressIds.map(addressId =>
    // Create get by key request
    BusinessPartnerAddress.requestBuilder().getByKey(
      businessPartnerId,
      addressId
    )
  );

  // Execute batch request combining multiple retrieve requests
  const batchResponses = await batch(...retrieveRequests).execute(destination);

  // ...
}
```
