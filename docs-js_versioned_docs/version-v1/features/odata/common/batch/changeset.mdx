A changeset is a collection of HTTP `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` operations - requests built by [`CreateRequestBuilder`s](#create-request-builder), [`UpdateRequestBuilder`s](#update-request-builder), and [`DeleteRequestBuilder`s](#delete-request-builder) in terms of the SAP Cloud SDK.
The order of execution within a changeset is not defined.
This differs from the whole batch request itself, where the order is defined.
Therefore, the requests within one changeset should not depend on each other.
If the execution of any request within a changeset fails, the whole changeset will be reflected as an error in the response.
The changeset will not be applied, much like a database transaction.

Unlike retrieve requests, you can not pass change requests to the `batch` function directly.
You have to combine them in a `changeset`, which in turn can be passed to the `batch` function.
Once a batch request is executed, it returns a list of [`BatchResponse`s](#responses).

If a changeset was executed successfully, its corresponding response is of type `WriteResponses` and contains a collection of all raw responses to the requests in the changeset.
If the execution fails, the response is an `ErrorResponse`.

In the example below, we create a list of [`UpdateRequestBuilder`s](#update-request-builder) from a list of addresses.
We combine these change requests into one `changeset` and pass it to the `batch` request, which we execute against a destination.

Once we execute the `batch` request, we get a list of `BatchResponse`s, which in this example contains one response only, i.e. the one for the changeset.

```ts
async function updateAddresses(
  businessPartnerAddresses: BusinessPartnerAddress[]
): Promise<BusinessPartnerAddress[]> {
  // Create update requests
  const updateRequests = businessPartnerAddresses.map(address =>
    BusinessPartnerAddress.requestBuilder().update(address)
  );

  // Execute batch request with one changeset
  const batchResponses = await batch(
    // Combine update requests into one changeset
    changeset(...updateRequests)
  ).execute(destination);

  // Get response for the changeset request
  const changesetResponse = batchResponses[0];

  // ...
}
```
