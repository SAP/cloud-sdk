## What OData Protocol Versions Are Supported?

| OData protocol version          | SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [OData v2](odata-v2-client.mdx) | &#10003;                     |
| [OData v4](odata-v4-client.mdx) | &#10003;                     |

## What Is OData?

[OData](https://www.odata.org/) is an open standard for building and consuming RESTful APIs.
It defines a query language to send and retrieve data via HTTP and to perform operations on data.

There are two widely used versions of the protocol: OData v2 and OData v4.
The latter comes with more and improved functionality.
Full details on the standards are to be found in the [documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/).

## Pregenerated OData Clients

The SAP Cloud SDK includes pregenerated JavaScript/TypeScript clients for all OData-based SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise services.
Those clients simplify service consumption by exposing a typed and fluent API.
This API allows you to explore and autocomplete requests against the SAP S/4HANA services.

There are more than 400 pregenerated clients with the following naming patterns:

- SAP S/4HANA Cloud: `@sap/cloud-sdk-vdm-<service name>-service`
- SAP S/4HANA On-Premise: `@sap/cloud-sdk-op-vdm-<service name>-service`

:::info Virtual Data Model (VDM)
Sometimes the pregenerated clients for SAP S/4HANA are referred to as _Virtual Data Model (VDM)_.
This is why the naming pattern for the pregenerated clients contains `vdm` as well.

### Legal

All SAP Cloud SDK's pregenerated client libraries are distributed under the [SAP developer license agreement](https://tools.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_1.txt).
This limits the use of the pregenerated clients to development purposes only.

## Code Generator

If you want to use an OData service, that has no pregenerated client, you can use the [client generator](generate-odata-client.mdx) to generate your own client.
You can do it for any service either developed by yourself, provided by SAP, or by other 3rd parties.

- Service definition usually comes in form of the `.edmx` file and contains metadata of OData service.
  The simplest way to obtain it if you have access to the service is by navigating to the `http(s)://<service-path>/$metadata` endpoint.
  You can generate a client for any 3rd party service or a service that you have built on your own.
- You can invoke the code generator via our command-line interface (CLI).

## Connectivity

We simplify connectivity to SAP-enabled OData services via type-safe abstractions over [Destinations](../connectivity/destination), Authentication, and some other related concepts.
