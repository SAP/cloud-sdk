1. Currently, the `Entity Type` is not supported to be used as the parameters of the function import.
   Function imports with such unsupported parameters are ignored during the generation.
   This feature will be implemented in the future.
   Please check this [issue](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/707) and comment if you need this feature.
2. Also, for the time being, we only support `unbound functions`.
   The `bound functions` will be supported later, you can create a feature request [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+request&template=feature_request.md&title=).
