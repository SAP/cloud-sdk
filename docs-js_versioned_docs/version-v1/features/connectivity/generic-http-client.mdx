## What Is the Generic HTTP Client?

In the [Executing a request using a generated OData client](../odata/execute-odata-request.mdx) section, we explained how to make OData requests using the generated OData client.
This client is the highest layer of convenience and type safety for the user.
Below the OData client uses the generic HTTP client of the SAP Cloud SDK.
For the final HTTP calls, the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript uses the axios library.

In this document, we explain when and how to use the middle layer directly.
Different clients serve different purposes:

**OData Client:**
Provides strong typing for the request (payload, select, filter, etc.) and response.
For each OData service, a separate client needs to be generated which defines the types and methods for this service.
The client takes care of deserializing your request to a URL and JSON payload as well as serializing the response.
The generated payload and URL are passed to the Generic HTTP Client.

**Generic HTTP Client:**
Adds SAP infrastructure-specific functionality on top of a standard HTTP Client.
All OData services use the same generic HTTP client, so it contains no service-specific information.
The client handles connectivity related issues such as:

- [Destination lookup](../connectivity/destination.mdx)
- Connections to [SAP S/4HANA On-premise](../connectivity/on-premise.mdx) via the connectivity service
- [Web proxies](../connectivity/proxy.mdx).

In the end, all information from the destination, connectivity service, and proxy configuration ends up in header fields and [proxy-agents](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-agent).
The information goes one level down to the axios client.

**axios HTTP Client:**
Is a widely used open-source [HTTP client for node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).
This client executes the actual HTTP requests in the end.

## How to Use It

To make a request using the Generic HTTP client use the `executeHttpRequest` function.

```ts
executeHttpRequest(destination, requestConfig, httpRequestOptions);
```

The `destination` argument is either a full <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.Destination" name="destination object" />, that you have already fetched or an <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="interfaces/sap_cloud_sdk_connectivity.DestinationFetchOptions" name="object containing a destination name and an optional JWT" />.
In the latter case, the SAP Cloud SDK fetches the destination for you.
For more details, see [here](destination.mdx).
The <LinkToLatestJsApiDocs slug="modules/sap_cloud_sdk_http_client#HttpRequestConfig" name="request configuration" /> argument contains the request configuration.
A minimal configuration would look like this:

```JSON
{
  method: 'get',
  params: {
    a: 'a',
    b: 'b'
  },
  ...
}
```

Note that you can also give values for `url` in the request configuration.
The values you give in the request configuration will be merged with ones related to the destination:

```ts
{
  ...destinationRequestConfig,
  ...customRequestConfig,
  headers: {
   ...destinationRequestConfig.headers,
   ...customRequestConfig.headers
}
```

For keys that exist for both objects, the value from the custom request configuration will be used.
For example, a request configuration with `authorization` headers will overwrite the authorization header information from the destination.

You can also pass an optional third parameter `httpRequestOptions`, where you can indicate, for example, whether the SAP Cloud SDK should fetch `CSRF` token for a non-GET request.
For a GET request, the `CSRF` token is not fetched and this option is ignored.

Below is an example of the `httpRequestOptions` to delegate the `CSRF` token fetching to the SAP Cloud SDK.

```JSON
{
     fetchCsrfToken: true
}
```

By default, the value of `fetchCsrfToken` is false.

## When to Use It

You should consider the Generic HTTP client if:

- You need to use an unsupported feature by the typed OData Client like `upsert` for example.
  With this, you can profit from the aforementioned convenience in connectivity.
- You want to ping a service or trigger a function import without a complicated payload.
  In such a case the size of a full data model of the typed client is perhaps not worth the benefits.
- You want to call a non-OData service that has no service definition.

You should consider the OData client if:

- You have to build complicated filter, selection, and/or expand conditions.
  Here you will highly benefit from the help of the OData client.
- You want to update or create new entities.
  The OData Client has built-in `ETag` versions handling.
  With the generic client, you have to manage versions on your own.

## Headers and Query Parameters from Different Origins

As partially described in the [destination guide](./destination#additional-headers-and-query-parameters-on-destinations), there are multiple possible origins for query parameters:

- Provided by the user on the request level.
  These parameters are referred to as `custom` parameters.
- Defined by the destination object or properties.
- Introduced by the SAP Cloud SDK.
  These parameters are referred to as `internal` parameters.

In case there are parameters with the same key from multiple origins the priority is:

1. `Custom` headers and parameters
2. `Destination` headers and parameters
3. `Internal` headers and parameters

### Custom Headers and Query Parameters

The code snippets demonstrate how to provide custom headers and parameters:

```ts
executeHttpRequest(myDestination, {
  headers: {
    apiKey: 'my-api-key'
  },
  params: {
    myParam: 'my-param'
  }
});
```

### Headers and Query Parameters from Destination

You set these parameters on the destination object as described [here](./destination#additional-headers-and-query-parameters-on-destinations).
The example below shows how to get:

- parsed parameters in the `queryParameters` property of the destination object
- `authentication` value from the destination object, which will be used for the authentication header

```ts
const { queryParameters, authentication } = await getDestination({
  destinationName: 'myDestination',
  jwt: 'yourJwt'
});
```

### Provide Headers and Query Parameters with Origin information

:::caution
This is an SAP Cloud SDK version 2.x feature.
:::

In some situations you want to define the priority of headers and parameters:

- You want to enforce a hard-coded API key/JWT and ignore the ones from e.g. the destination
- You want a default query parameter, which can be overwritten by the destination properties

Check the example below, how you can define the headers and parameters with origin information:

```ts
executeHttpRequestWithOrigin(myDestination, {
  headers: {
    custom: { apiKey: 'custom-header' },
    requestConfig: { apiKey: 'default-header' }
  },
  params: {
    custom: { myParam: 'custom-param' },
    requestConfig: { myParam: 'default-param' }
  }
});
```

## Encoding

:::info
This section applies to version 2 of the SAP Cloud SDK.
For version 1 of the SAP Cloud SDK, encoding is done on OData-related query parameters without a way to configure it.
:::

In the end, query parameters end up in the URL to the target system.
Therefore, special characters with a meaning in a URL need to be [% encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).
The SAP Cloud SDK takes care of this encoding depending on the origin you use.
For calls executed via a typed client and generic HTTP client the encoding is done as:

- `Custom` parameters are not encoded.
  The idea behind this is to give you a way to send parameters with the highest priority to the target system as they are.
- `Destination` parameters are encoded.
- `Internal` parameters are encoded.

For the `executeHttpRequest` method, an option is available to adjust the behavior.

```ts
const parameterEncoder = function (
  params: Record<string, any>
): Record<string, any> {
  // your custom implementation
};
executeHttpRequest(destination, { parameterEncoder });
```

The `parameterEncoder` function is applied to the keys and values of all parameters of the request.
In case you need to encode all parameters including custom ones, we exported a `encodeAllParameters` method to do that.
Pass this method as the `parameterEncoder` to the `executeHttpRequest` call.

Note that this option is not available for the OData and OpenApi clients.
The typed clients take care of encoding already, and an additional encoding layer would lead to errors.
