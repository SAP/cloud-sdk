Typical cases, where you might need to use `executeRaw` are:

- You need additional information about the response, like the status code or response headers.
- You need additional information about the request that has been sent, like payload, method, or request headers.
- The function `execute` is omitted in some request builders because the response data cannot be deserialized by the request builder.
- Debugging purposes.
