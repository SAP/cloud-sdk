## Introduction

This guide provides examples on how to create and manage deployments in SAP AI Core using the SAP AI SDK for Java.

:::warning
All classes under any of the `...model` packages are generated from an OpenAPI specification and marked as `@Beta`.
This means that these model classes are not guaranteed to be stable and may change with future releases.
They are safe to use, but may require updates even in minor releases.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before using the AI Core module, ensure that you have met all the general requirements outlined in the [overview](../overview-cloud-sdk-for-java#general-requirements).
Additionally, include the necessary Maven dependency in your project.

### Maven Dependencies

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.ai.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>${ai-sdk.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

See [an example pom in our Spring Boot application](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java/tree/main/sample-code/spring-app/pom.xml)

## Usage

In addition to the prerequisites above, we assume you have already set up the following to carry out the examples in this guide:

- **An AI Core Configuration** created in SAP AI Core.

  - <details>
<summary>Example configuration from the AI Core <code>/configuration</code> endpoint</summary>

        ```json
        {
          "createdAt": "2024-07-03T12:44:08Z",
          "executableId": "azure-openai",
          "id": "12345-123-123-123-123456abcdefg",
          "inputArtifactBindings": [],
          "name": "gpt-35-turbo",
          "parameterBindings": [
            {
              "key": "modelName",
              "value": "gpt-35-turbo"
            },
            {
              "key": "modelVersion",
              "value": "latest"
            }
          ],
          "scenarioId": "foundation-models"
        }
        ```

        </details>

## Create a Deployment

Use the following code snippet to create a deployment in SAP AI Core:

```java
var api = new DeploymentApi();
var resourceGroupId = "default";
var configurationId = "12345-123-123-123-123456abcdefg";

var request = AiDeploymentCreationRequest.create().configurationId(configurationId);
var deployment = api.create(resourceGroupId, request);

String id = deployment.getId();
AiExecutionStatus status = deployment.getStatus();
```

Refer to the [DeploymentController.java](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java/tree/main/sample-code/spring-app/src/main/java/com/sap/ai/sdk/app/controllers/DeploymentController.java) in our Spring Boot application for a complete example.

## Delete a Deployment

```java
AiDeploymentCreationResponse deployment; // provided
String deploymentId = deployment.getId();

var api = new DeploymentApi();
var resourceGroupId = "default";

if (deployment.getStatus() == AiExecutionStatus.RUNNING) {
  // Only RUNNING deployments can be STOPPED
  api.modify(
    resourceGroupId,
    deploymentId,
    AiDeploymentModificationRequest.create().targetStatus(AiDeploymentTargetStatus.STOPPED));
}
// Wait a few seconds for the deployment to stop
// Only UNKNOWN and STOPPED deployments can be DELETED
api.delete(resourceGroupId, deployment.getId());
```

Refer to the [DeploymentController.java](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java/tree/main/sample-code/spring-app/src/main/java/com/sap/ai/sdk/app/controllers/DeploymentController.java) in our Spring Boot application for a complete example.
