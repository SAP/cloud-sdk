## Why the SAP Cloud SDK for Java?

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java makes it easy to build highly connected, resilient, multi tenant SaaS applications on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
It enables you to perform outbound requests using various protocols while only writing the business logic.

For example, with the SAP Cloud SDK for Java you can connect to an SAP S/4HANA (Cloud) system via OData with only a few lines of code:

```java
HttpDestination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-s4-system").asHttp();

List<MeasuringPoint> result =  new DefaultMeasuringPointService()
          .getAllMeasuringPoint()
          .select(MEASURING_POINT, CREATION_DATE, FUNCTIONAL_LOCATION)
          .top(5)
          .execute(destination);
```

This example uses the pre-generated OData client together with the destination API to interact with the [Measuring Point Service](https://api.sap.com/api/MEASURINGPOINT_0001/overview) of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

## Main Features of the SAP Cloud SDK for Java

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java brings a wide variety of features to power your business application.

At its core, the SAP Cloud SDK for Java integrates the SAP BTP Destination and Connectivity services with powerful clients (e.g. OData) in a multi tenant and resilient manner.
This integration reduces the code for typical outbound requests down to just a few statements.

The image below shows a typical architecture of an application built with the SAP Cloud SDK:

### Connectivity

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java provides an API that abstracts the details of establishing connections to other systems: The [Destination API](features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-destination-service).

You can [access destinations defined in the SAP BTP Cockpit](features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-destination-service#accessing-destinations) directly in your code.
Or you can define your own destinations, for example to [connect to SAP BTP services](features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-destination-service#skip-destination-creation-step-for-certain-authentication-types-on-cloud-foundry).

You can then use these destinations for performing REST (OpenAPI or OData), RFC or SOAP requests.
Or you can [get a ready-made Http Client](features/connectivity/sdk-connectivity-http-client#general-usage) for a destination to execute your own requests.

### Supported Platforms and Environments

TBD

CF, K8S, KYMA, BAS, (NEO)

The SAP Cloud SDK abstracts away from details of the underlying platform the application is running upon.
This enables applications to adopt platform changes or fully switch to a different platform without any code changes.


### Supported Java Versions

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java runs with Java 8 or higher.
For Spring based applications the latest Java version is supported.

For apps build on TomEE / Tomcat Java 11 is supported.
Higher versions bring incompatible changes with the transition from the `javax.servlet` to the `jakarta.servlet` package for servlets which is currently not supported by the SAP Cloud SDK.

### Availability and Licensing

All libraries are available on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.dev/search?namespace=com.sap.cloud.sdk) under the [SAP Developer license](https://tools.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_1.txt).
The license of clients generated with any of the SAP Cloud SDK code generators depends on the used service spec license.

### Release Schedule

We usually release minor versions bi-weekly.

We intend to release a new major version of the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript every twelve months.
For details, check the [release policy](release-policy).

### Support

The SAP Cloud SDK is actively supported via various internal and external channels which you can find [here](support-java).
