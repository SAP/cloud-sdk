[SAP Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) is a managed Kubernetes service by SAP developed as an Open Source project.
It helps create and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters with less effort by abstracting environment specifics to deliver the same homogeneous Kubernetes-native DevOps experience everywhere.

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java supports SAP Gardener-based Kubernetes clusters out of the box.

## SAP Cloud SDK Features Supported on SAP Gardener

Find below the list of features we currently support:
Legend: ✅ - supported, ❗- partially supported, ❌ - not supported

## Getting Started with the SAP Cloud SDK on Gardener

This detailed guide will help get your SAP Cloud SDK Java application up and running in the SAP Gardener-based Kubernetes cluster.
You can also use this guide to migrate your existing application to Kubernetes.

:::tip

For additional information on more deployment options you can also check out the [guide for JavaScript](http://localhost:3000/cloud-sdk/docs/js/guides/migrate-sdk-application-from-btp-cf-to-kubernetes#configure-tls-and-obtain-a-domain-in-sap-gardener).

:::

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide you will need:

- A [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) managed cluster
- The [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator/) installed in the Cluster (minimum version `0.2.3`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and a publicly reachable Docker repository
- A [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) Application using the SAP Cloud SDK

Check out the details below in case you are uncertain about any of the prerequisites.

<details>
  <summary>Gardener Cluster</summary>

This guide assumes you have created a cluster via Gardener dashboard, have [Kubernetes CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed on your local machine and have it set up for cluster access.

:::tip
Running `kubectl cluster-info` should print out your cluster endpoints.

In case you haven't set this up you can do so by downloading a `kubeconfig` from your Gardener dashboard.
You can read more about accessing clusters using `kubeconfig` on the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)
:::

We also recommend to have an Ingress set up that exposes the application to the internet.
You can read more about configuring an Ingress on the [Gardener documentation](https://gardener.cloud/docs/guides/applications/service-access/#loadbalancer-vs-ingress).

</details>

<details>
  <summary>SAP BTP Service Operator</summary>

This guide assumes you have the [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/Cloud/en-US/b5a35bfa87b5444080e6e6e6d361fa20.html) installed in your cluster.
The operator is used to create and bind service instances.
The same can also be achieved via the [Service Catalog](https://help.sap.com/viewer/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/Cloud/en-US/20195bf3b6e64189966e08f669c275e1.html).
However, this guide will focus on the Service Operator usage.

:::tip
In case you don't have it installed please follow the [documentation](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator#sap-business-technology-platform-sap-btp-service-operator-for-kubernetes) to install it.
:::

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Docker</summary>

This guide assumes you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your local machine.

Furthermore, you need a **Docker repository** where you can store images.
The repository needs to be publicly accessible in order for the cluster to access and download the Docker image we are going to create.

In case you don't have such a repository yet we recommend either:

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- [Artifactory DMZ](https://common.repositories.cloud.sap/ui/) (for SAP internal developers)

Access to images in a repository may be limited to authenticated and/or authorized users, depending on your configuration.

Make sure you are logged in to your repository on your local machine by running:

```bash
docker login (your-repo) --username=(your-username)
```

And check your configuration which is usually located under `(your-home-directory)/.docker/config.json`.

:::tip
In case AuthN/AuthZ is required to download images make sure you have a [secret configured in your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-by-providing-credentials-on-the-command-line):

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry (name-of-the-secret) --docker-username=(username) --docker-password=(API-token) --docker-server=(your-repo)
```

:::

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Application using the SAP Cloud SDK</summary>

If you don't have an application already you can comfortably [create one from our archetypes](../getting-started).

</details>

### Containerize the Application

To run on Kubernetes the application needs to be shipped in a container.
For this guide we will be using Docker.

Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root directory:

```dockerfile {2}
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
ARG JAR_FILE=application/target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
EXPOSE 8080
```

If needed, update the `JAR_FILE` to point to your JAR file.

:::tip
You can find more information on how to containerize Spring Boot applications in [this guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker/) (in particular, check the _Containerize It_ section).
:::

Compile and push the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t <your-repo>/<your-image-name> .
docker push <your-repo>/<your-image-name>
```

:::tip
In case you are facing authorization issues when pushing to your repository refer to the dedicated section under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
:::

### Create a Kubernetes Deployment

1. Create a new YAML file describing the Kubernetes deployment:

   ```yml title="deployment.yml" {18,32}
   ---
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
           # Configure the docker image you just pushed to your repository here
           - image: <your-repo>/<your-image>:latest
             name: my-app
             imagePullPolicy: Always
             resources:
               requests:
                 memory: '1Gi'
                 cpu: '500m'
               limits:
                 memory: '1.5Gi'
                 cpu: '750m'
             # Volume mounts needed for injecting BTP service credentials
             volumeMounts:
         imagePullSecrets:
           # In case your repository requires a login, reference your secret here
           - name: <your-secret-for-docker-login>
         # Volumes containing BTP serice credentials from secrets
         volumes:
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: my-app
     name: my-app
     namespace: default
   spec:
     type: NodePort
     ports:
       - port: 8080
     selector:
       app: my-app
   ```

2. Install the configuration via `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`.

3. Monitor the status of the deployment by running: `kubectl get deployment my-app-deployment`.

Eventually, you should see an output similar to:

```
$ kubectl get deployment my-app-deployment

NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
my-app-deployment   1/1     1            1           15s
```

:::tip
In case something went wrong use `kubectl describe` together with `deployment` or `pod` to get more information about the status of your application.
:::

### Create an Ingress

To make your application available from outside the cluster we will create an Ingress.

:::note
In case you already have an Ingress configured in your cluster only add the new `rule` for your new applications.

You can read more about configuring an Ingress on the [Gardener documentation](https://gardener.cloud/docs/guides/applications/service-access/#loadbalancer-vs-ingress).
:::

1. Create a new YAML file containing the following Ingress configuration:

```yml title="ingress.yml" {12-13,16}
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-router
  namespace: default
  annotations:
  # cert.gardener.cloud/purpose: managed
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
      # - "<your-cluster-host>"
      # - "*.ingress.<your-cluster-host>"
    # secretName: secret-tls
  rules:
    - host: 'my-app.ingress.<your-cluster-host>'
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

2. Install the configuration via `kubectl apply -f ingress.yml`.

3. Verify the Ingress is up and running: `kubectl describe ingress ingress-router`

You should see an entry with the path `/` pointing to the backend `my-app`.

:::note
In case something went wrong and you are struggling to configure the Ingress you can also come back and set it up later.
The Ingress is a convenient way to access your application.
It is not strictly required for the rest of this guide.
:::

<details>
  <summary>Recommended: Configure TLS for your Ingress</summary>

Enable the NGINX Ingress add-on in your Gardener dashboard.
The process may take a few minutes.
Afterwards, you should see a domain in the dashboard as well as a Kubernetes secret `secret-tls`.

Un-comment the 4 lines in the YAML above using the generated domain and secret.
Then re-deploy the configuration as usual.
Your cluster endpoint should now be trusted by your browser.

</details>

:::tip
We highly recommended enabling TLS for your cluster endpoints.
It ensures your client (e.g. browser) can verify the cluster's identity.
:::

### Access Your Application

At this point take a moment to verify you can access your application.
Use the host you have defined in your Ingress rule in a browser or other tool of your choice (e.g. Postman).
In case you started with an SAP Cloud SDK Archetype your should be greeted with a welcome page under the root path.

:::note
In case you skipped setting up an Ingress before you can use port forwarding to access your application.

Identify the pod name of your application with `kubectl get pods`.
Then enable port forwarding to it by running: `kubectl port-forward (your-pod-name) 8080:8080`.
With that you should be able to access the application on your `http://localhost:8080`
:::

### Bind SAP BTP Services to the Application

The SAP Business Technology Platform offers various services that can be used by applications.
To access services from a Kubernetes environment instances have to be created and bound to the application.

For this guide we'll assume we want to use two services:

1. Destination Service
2. Identity and Authentication Service (IAS)

#### Bind the Destination Service

1. Create a new YAML file:

```yml title="destination-service.yaml"
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: destination-service
spec:
  serviceOfferingName: destination
  servicePlanName: lite
  externalName: default-destination-service
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: my-destination-service-binding
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: destination-service
  secretName: my-destination-service-secret
```

2. Install the configuration via `kubectl apply -f destination-service.yml`.

3. Monitor the status via `kubectl describe ServiceInstance destination-service`.
   Eventually this should automatically create a Kubernetes secret named `my-destination-service-secret`.
   This secret will contain the actual service binding information.

4. Mount the `my-destination-service-secret` secret into the file system of the application as follows:

   1. Find the empty list of `volumes` at the end of your `deployment.yml`.
      Add a new volume, referencing the secret:

      ```yml title="volumes:"
      - name: my-destination-service-binding-volume
        secret:
          secretName: my-destination-service-secret
      ```

   2. Mount this volume into the file system of your application.
      Add it to the empty list of `volumeMounts` in the `container` section of your `deployment.yml`:

      ```yml title="volumeMounts:"
      - name: my-destination-service-binding-volume
        mountPath: '/etc/secrets/sapbtp/my-destination-service'
        readOnly: true
      ```

5. Update the configuration via `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`.

#### Bind the Identity and Authentication Service

1. Create a new `identity-service.yaml` file:

```yml title="identity-service.yaml"
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceInstance
metadata:
  name: my-identity-service
spec:
  serviceOfferingName: identity
  servicePlanName: application
  parameters:
    # Allowed redirect URIs in case you want to use an approuter behind an ingress for user login
    # oauth2-configuration:
    #  redirect-uris:
    #    - https://*.ingress.<your-cluster-host>/login/callback
    consumed-services: []
    xsuaa-cross-consumption: true
    multi-tenant: true
---
apiVersion: services.cloud.sap.com/v1
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: my-identity-service-binding
spec:
  serviceInstanceName: my-identity-service
  secretName: my-identity-service-secret
```

2. Repeat the same steps 2-5 from the previous section, always replacing `destination` with `identity`.

## On-Premise Connectivity

On Kubernetes there are generally two approaches to connect to On-Premise destinations:

1. Using Transparent Proxy and Connectivity Proxy
2. Using Connectivity Proxy only

Approach **(1)** simplifies the application code but does not cover all features at the time of writing.

<details>
  <summary>Constraints when using the Transparent Proxy</summary>

- Private Link not yet supported
- Destination names need to be known at design time
  - see the note on [Create a Kubernetes Resource](#create-a-kubernetes-resource)

</details>

Approach **(2)** does not come with the above constraints, but imposes limitations on the operation mode.

<details>
  <summary>Constraints when using the Connectivity Proxy</summary>

- Connectivity Proxy must be operated in `untrusted` mode

</details>

:::tip
We generally recommend to go with approach (1) unless the given constraints apply to your use case.
:::

### 1. Using Transparent and Connectivity Proxies

#### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have both the **Transparent Proxy** (version `>= 1.3.0`) and **Connectivity Proxy** (version `>= 2.9.2`) installed in your cluster.
Please refer to [this](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/1c18e0ca10884dad994fc3d7e1d046d7.html) and [this](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/23fc1100c60b45c58f09694b7f9c7700.html) documentation on how to install it if you haven't already.

#### Background Information

When using the Transparent Proxy your app performs requests against the Transparent Proxy without explicit authentication, assuming the network in your cluster can be trusted.
The Transparent Proxy will obtain the relevant destination from the destination service and use it to forward the request via the Connectivity Proxy to the On-Premise system.
Consequently, your app itself does not interact with destination or connectivity service at all and thus your application pods do not require bindings to these two services.

:::tip
This approach is conceptually different from what you may be used to from a CloufdFoundry environment.
The official [documentation of the Transparent Proxy](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/e661713ef7d14373b57e3e26b0b03b86.html) gives more information on the architecture.
:::

#### Create a Kubernetes Resource

Create the following YAML file:

```yaml title:"example-dest.yaml"
apiVersion: destination.connectivity.api.sap/v1
kind: Destination
metadata:
  name: example-dest
spec:
  destinationRef:
    name: 'example-dest-onprem' # name from BTP Cockpit
  destinationServiceInstanceName: dest-service-instance-example # can be ommited if config.destinationService.defaultInstanceName was provided to the helm chart of the transparent proxy upon installation
```

- Adjust the name `example-dest-onprem` to the On-Premise destination you defined in your SAP BTP Cockpit.

It will create a Kubernetes resource in your cluster, pointing to the destination you created in the cockpit.
Apply the YAML with `kubectl apply` to take effect.

:::note
This step is required for each destination that should be reachable via the Transparent Proxy.
If you do not create a custom Kubernetes resource of type `destinations.destination.connectivity.api.sap` for a given destination, the destination will not be handled by the Transparent Proxy.
:::

#### Executing Requests

In your application you can now configure a destination to execute requests:

```java
DefaultHttpDestination destination = DefaultHttpDestination
        .builder("http://example-dest.namespace/")
        // for a subscriber tenant make sure to send the tenant header:
        // .header(new Header("X-Tenant-Id", TenantAccessor.getCurrentTenant().getTenantId()))
        // for principal propagation make sure to set the auth type to "TOKEN_FORWARDING":
        // .authenticationType(AuthenticationType.TOKEN_FORWARDING)
        .build();

List<SalesArea> execute = new DefaultSalesAreaService().getAllSalesArea() // example OData request
        .execute(destination);
```

- Replace `namespace` in the URL with the namespace you installed the Transparent Proxy into

This will target the Kubernetes resource `example-dest` we created above which will be resolved to the destination we configured in that resource.
The code above shows an example how you can use it to perform an OData request.

:::note
Repeat this process for all _destination names_ you want to use in your application.
:::

:::tip Connecting to Cloud systems
The above approach is not limited to destinations of proxy type `ON_PREMISE`.
`INTERNET` destinations are equally supported.
:::

### 2. Using the Connectivity Proxy

#### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have the Connectivity Proxy installed in the [**untrusted mode**](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/148bbad274e545efa10de8a356dd474d.html) in your cluster.
In case you used the Helm chart to install the proxy, the untrusted mode is enabled if the property `config.servers.proxy.http.enableProxyAuthorization` is set to `true`.
Please refer to [this](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/23fc1100c60b45c58f09694b7f9c7700.html) documentation on how to install the Connectivity Proxy if you haven't already.

The untrusted mode requires a service binding or service key for an XSUAA service instance.
Make sure you have this binding/key at hand as you will need it in the steps below.

### Create a Kubernetes Secret

Copy the following JSON template:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "label": "connectivity",
  "provider": null,
  "plan": "lite",
  "name": "connectivity",
  "tags": ["connectivity", "conn", "connsvc"],
  "instance_guid": "",
  "instance_name": "connectivity",
  "binding_guid": "",
  "binding_name": null,
  "credentials": {
    "tenantmode": "",
    "clientid": "",
    "token_service_domain": "",
    "token_service_url": "",
    "xsappname": "",
    "clientsecret": "",
    "url": "",
    "uaadomain": "",
    "verificationkey": "",
    "identityzone": "",
    "tenantid": "",
    "onpremise_proxy_port": "20003",
    "onpremise_proxy_http_port": "20003",
    "onpremise_socks5_proxy_port": "20004",
    "onpremise_proxy_ldap_port": "20001",
    "onpremise_proxy_rfc_port": "20001",
    "onpremise_proxy_host": ""
  }
}
```

Perform the following adjustments:

- Generate two random GUIDs and fill them into the fields `instance_guid` and `binding_guid`
- Fill the fields from line **16-26** with the corresponding values from the XSUAA credentials you created to run the Connectivity Proxy in untrusted mode
  - For `url` use the same value as `token_service_url`
- Update `onpremise_proxy_host` to contain the URL under which the Connectivity Proxy is reachable within your cluster
- Update the ports in case you configured custom values for them on the Connectivity Proxy

Next, create a new YAML file and insert the prepared JSON object into `connectivity-service-key`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: connectivity-service-secret
type: Opaque
   stringData:
    connectivity-service-key: '{
        "label": "connectivity",
        "provider": null,
        ....
      }'
```

Finally, adjust your deployment YAML to contain these two entries under `volumes` and `volumteMounts`:

```yml title="deployment.yaml:"
  volumes:
    - name: conectivity-service-binding-volume
      secret:
        secretName: connectivity-service-secret
volumeMounts:
      - name: conectivity-service-binding-volume
        mountPath: '/etc/secrets/sapbtp/connectivity/connectivity-service'
        readOnly: true
```

Apply the YAML files for the changes to take effect.
Your app should now be ready to connect to On-Premise systems via the Connectivity Proxy.

:::tip Troubleshooting
Issues about _"No connectivity service biding found"_ usually indicate a misconfiguration with the created secret.
To fix them, please double check the JSON, the secret, and the volume mounts
:::

## Excursion: Debug Kubernetes App From Your Local IDE

To understand some problems with an application it might be helpful to debug the application from within your IDE.
Then you can go through the code step by step and see, where your expectations are not fulfilled anymore.

This excursion will guide you through the necessary steps to get your application running on your Kubernetes cluster connected to your local IDE.

1. Add the following parameter to your invocation of the JVM:

   ```text
   -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005
   ```

   As an example, let's assume that your Dockerfile has the following entrypoint:

   ```Dockerfile
   ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
   ```

   Then you can update your deployment by adding the `command` and `args` properties to your image spec in your deployment.yml:

   ```yml
   spec: # pod spec
     containers:
       - image: <your-image-spec>
         name: <your-container-name>
         command: ['java']
         args:
           [
             '-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005',
             '-jar',
             '/app.jar'
           ]
   ```

   This will replace the entrypoint with the given command and arguments, as described in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/).

2. Make sure that the adjusted image is actually running in your Kubernetes Cluster.

3. Identify the pod you want to debug against, for example using the `kubectl get pods` command.

4. Forward the port used in the debug String above via the following command to your local machine:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward <name-of-your-pod> 5005:5005
   ```

5. Let your IDE connect against `localhost:5005`.
   The specifics of this step depend heavily on your choice of IDE, so we cannot give a fits-all solution.
