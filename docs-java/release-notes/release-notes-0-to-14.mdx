## 5.14.0 - November 08, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.14.0)

### 📈 Improvements

- Minor improvement on OpenAPI code generator to apply Javadoc on customized model class constructors.
- Fix a TLS compatibility issue between the latest _Apache HttpClient 5_ and on-premise connectivity (via SAP Cloud Connector).
- Stabilize ApacheHttpClient5 related API without changes.
  The `@Beta` annotations are removed in most places and consuming applications no longer need to suppress warnings.

## 5.13.0 - September 27, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.13.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- Minimum required versions:
  - SAP BTP Security Services Integration Libraries `com.sap.cloud.security` 3.4.3
  - CAP `com.sap.cds` 2.9.3
  - SAP Java Buildpack `com.sap.cloud.sjb` 2.10.0
- Using IAS requires XSUAA version to be minimum `3.4.0`.
- Change the `DefaultHttpDestination.Builder` to throw an exception when the proxy configuration can not be determined for on-premise destinations.
  Previously, only an error was logged to give a grace period for analyzing and fixing the underlying issue.
- Change the default implementations of `HttpClientCache` and `ApacheHttpClient5Cache` to throw an exception in cases where previously only an error was logged.
  The previous behavior of logging an error and falling back to creating a new http client granted a grace period to fix the underlying issue.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- OpenAPI QueryParameters are now encoded

### 🐛 Known Issues

- Using the latest Apache HttpClient 5 to connect to on-premise systems (via SAP Cloud Connector), may result in "403 Forbidden" responses due to a TLS compatibility issue.
  Please use older version SAP Cloud SDK `5.12.0` or use upcoming `5.14.0`.

## 5.12.0 - September 03, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.12.0)

### ✨ New Functionality

- Timeouts for OAuth2 token retrievals can now be customized.
  As part of `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` the new option `OAuth2Options.TokenRetrievalTimeout` can now be passed to set a custom timeout.
  Refer to [this documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/service-bindings#about-the-options) for more details.
- In `DestinationService` class allow for optional argument `DestinationServiceRetrievalStrategy` in method `getAllDestinationProperties`.
  This additional API allows for ensuring tenant-specific destination lookups.
  Available values are: `CURRENT_TENANT` (default), `ALWAYS_PROVIDER` and `ONLY_SUBSCRIBER`.

### 📈 Improvements

- \[OpenAPI Generator\] Setting the Maven plugin configuration property `openapi.generate.deleteOutputDirectory` to `true` will no longer result in deletion of all files from the `outputDirectory` prior to generation.
  Instead, only the `apiPackage`- and `apiPackage`-related directories will be cleaned.
  This reduces the risk of deleting files unexpectedly and allows for reusing the same `outputDirectory` for multiple generator plugin invocations.
- \[OpenAPI Generator\] The property accessors of generated model classes now have consistent `@Nullable` and `@Nonnull` annotation.
- \[OpenAPI Generator\] Enable the option `<enumUnknownDefaultCase>` that allows for lenient handling of unknown enum values coming from a server.
- Upgrade to version `1.66.0` of `gRPC` dependencies coming in transitively when using `connectivity-ztis`
- Improve the error handling for OData batch requests.
  In case an OData error is given within a batch response it will now be parsed and returned as `ODataServiceErrorException`.
- Reduce the amount of DwC headers sent when communicating via megaclite.
  This reduces the risk of exceeding the maximum header size limit of the Cloud Foundry infrastructure.
- Improve the error handling for requests to the destination service.
  In case of an error a potential response body will now be logged with the error message.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- fix: issue [#557](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/issues/557): DwC Auth Token not available (DwC + IAS) by @jingweiz2017 in #568
- Fix an issue where proxy headers are applied multiple times for On-Premise destinations.

## 5.11.0 - August 01, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.11.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- The OpenAPI generator doesn't add `//NOPMD` after imports anymore.

### ✨ New Functionality

- Add experimental support for [_Destination Fragments_](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/extending-destinations-with-fragments).
  Fragment names can be passed upon requesting destinations via `DestinationServiceOptionsAugmenter.fragmentName("my-fragment-name")`.
- Allow removing properties when using a destination builder.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- The OpenAPI Generator correctly declares `@Nonnull` and `@Nullable` annotations on generated endpoint methods.
- The OpenAPI Generator uses correct camelCase again, when creating methods to _add items_ to a collections.
  Version `5.10.0` used incorrect `addfooItems(Foo)` instead of `addFooItems(Foo)`.
  This is fixed now.

## 5.10.0 - June 12, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.10.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- Using the `X509_ATTESTED` credential type now requires a version >= `3.4.0` of the [SAP BTP Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library).
- Deprecate the IAS communication option `withConsumerClient(clientid, tenantid)`.
  The option is non-functional. Use `withConsumerClientId(clientid)` instead, the tenant will automatically be inferred from the context upon execution.

### ✨ New Functionality

- Support the `X509_ATTESTED` credential type for XSUAA service bindings.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue that prevented OAuth flows from working correctly for subscriber tenants when using IAS with credential type `X509_ATTESTED`

## 5.9.0 - May 13, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.9.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- Deprecate the `BtpServiceOptions.IasOptions.withTargetUri` method overloads.
  As a replacement, users should use the corresponding `BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri` method.
  Additionally, the existing behavior of the deprecated methods has been changed:
  They are no longer returning an instance of `BtpServiceOptions.IasOptions.IasTargetUri` but instead return now an instance of `BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.TargetUri`.
  The `BtpServiceOptions.IasOptions.IasTargetUri` class is also deprecated.

  **Please Note**:
  The deprecated methods will stay functioning (with the mentioned behavior changes) for a while to give users time to migrate to the new methods.
  Nevertheless, we are planning to **remove** the deprecated methods and the class **still within version 5 of the SAP Cloud SDK**.

### ✨ New Functionality

- Support the [OAuth Refresh Token](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/oauth-refresh-token-authentication) authentication type of the Destination Service.
  Find more details on how to use the functionality in the [documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/btp-destination-service#about-the-destinationservice).
- Service Bindings for the SAP XSUAA service (Service Identifier `xsuaa`) can now be converted into destinations just as any other supported service.
  This is most useful when combined with the newly introduced `BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri` methods, which allows for communication between services that are backed by the same XSUAA instance.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fix a regression that was introduced with the SAP Cloud SDK 5.0 release where the principal would no longer be derived from a `Basic` authorization header, in cases where neither a JWT nor an OIDC token was present.
- Fix a regression that was introduced with the SAP Cloud SDK 5.0 release where auth tokens sent by the Destination service would no longer be stored in the `cloudsdk.authTokens` destination property for non-HTTP destinations.

## 5.8.0 - April 22, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.8.0)

### 📈 Improvements

- Improve the efficiency of HTTP clients: The default cache duration for HTTP clients have been increased to expire one hour after last access (was 5 minutes after creation).
  Aside from a performance improvement, this improves the handling of cookies, as they are retained for much longer.
- Improve connecting to IAS-based applications and services.
  Scenarios where an IAS tenant is connected to multiple subaccounts of an application are now supported.
  - Note that when mocking an IAS binding for testing the binding entry `app_tid` is now required.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue that would cause a NPE when using bound services backed by IAS via the [dedicated service binding format](/docs/java/features/connectivity/service-bindings#service-binding-format).
- Fix an issue that would cause a NPE when using the OData `applyAction` method with a `null` parameter value.

## 5.7.0 - April 05, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.7.0)

### ✨ New Functionality

- (Beta) Add support for the SAP-internal Zero Trust Identity Service
  - Add a new module `connectivity-ztis`.
  - Add support for the credential-type `X509_ATTESTED` for all OAuth2 flows.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Stop unnecessarily throwing and catching `NullPointerException` when interacting with `DefaultHttpDestination#equals(...)` and `#hashCode()`.

## 5.6.0 - March 19, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.6.0)

### ✨ New Functionality

- Add support for connecting to applications and services backed by the [SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication).
  - The `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API now supports service bindings to the IAS service.
  - The `BtpServiceOptions` class has now offers `IasOptions` to pass additional options depending on the use case.
  - A standardised service binding format for IAS-backed services is introduced.
  - Support connecting to arbitrary services as long as their service binding conforms to the standardised format.
  - Head over to [the documentation](/docs/java/features/connectivity/service-bindings#using-the-identity-and-authentication-service-ias) for more information on the new features.
- Support service bindings to the [SAP BTP AI Core Service](https://api.sap.com/api/AI_CORE_API) by default in the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API.
- Failed OData v4 Batch requests now return the specific failed request from the exception: `ODataResponseException.getRequest()`.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where the same `HttpClient` would be used for different users when using `PrincipalPropagation` and thus could potentially share the same (session) cookies.
- Fix an issue where destinations for the Business Logging service that are created from a service binding (using the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API) contained the concrete API path.
  This behavior caused problems when using such a destination in a client generated with the SAP Cloud SDK's OpenApi generator.
- [DwC] Fix an issue where the `AuthTokenAccessor` would not recognize JWT tokens passed in via the `dwc-jwt` header.
- [DwC] Fix an issue where the current tenant would not be resolved if the `dwc-subdomain` header was missing.

## 5.5.0 - February 28, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.5.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- Deprecated `RfcDestination` and all associated usages, the replacement is `Destination`.

### ✨ New Functionality

- `war` deployment in combination with the `SAP Java Buildpack` 2.2.0 is supported again.
  Our `RFC` artifact is now released, and `JCo` functionalities are supported again.
  Please follow our [guide to update to version 5](../guides/5.0-upgrade-steps.mdx).

### 📈 Improvements

- Improve the `DefaultHttpDestination` builder API: For destinations with proxy type `ON_PREMISE` the proxy URL can now be customized by using the `proxy` method of the builder.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fixed an issue where adding header providers to a destination after it had already been used to obtain an Apache `HttpClient` 5 would not work as expected.

## 5.4.0 - February 15, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.4.0)

### 📈 Improvements

- Destination key-stores of type _PKCS #12_ with empty (or no) password will be correctly loaded, including their certificates.
- OpenAPI clients can now be generated with specifications with `oneOf` and `anyOf` keywords by enabling their processing by using `<enableOneofAnyofGeneration>` in `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`(This option is turned off by default):
  ```xml
  <plugin>
      <groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.datamodel</groupId>
      <artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      ...
      <configuration>
         ...
        <enableOneofAnyofGeneration>true</enableOneofAnyofGeneration>
      </configuration>
  </plugin>
  ```
  But,the generated client may not be feature complete and work as expected for all cases involving `anyOf/oneOf`.

## 5.3.0 - February 1, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.3.0)

### 📈 Improvements

- The destination property `HTML5.ForwardAuthToken` is now evaluated and forwards the current AuthToken to the target system.
- Improve how certificates are evaluated for the authentication types `SAMLAssertion` and `OAUTH2_SAML_BEARER_ASSERTION`.
  The certificates are no longer unnecessarily parsed when obtaining the destination.
- The `spring-boot3` archetype no longer contains the `integration-tests` module.
  The contained tests are now part of the test suite of the `application` module.
- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update [`com.sap.cloud.security`](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration) from `3.3.3` to `3.3.4`
    - Update [`com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding`](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access) from `0.10.1` to `0.10.2`
    - Update `com.sap.cloud:neo-java-web-api` from `4.67.12` to `4.68.9`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Major version updates:
      - Update [`org.apache.olingo`](https://github.com/apache/olingo-odata4) from `4.10.0` to `5.0.0`
      - Update [`io.github.resilience4j`](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) from `1.7.1` to `2.2.0`
    - Minor/Patch version updates:
      - Update [`org.slf4j:slf4j-api`](https://github.com/qos-ch/slf4j) from `2.0.9` to `2.0.11`
      - Update [`commons-io:commons-io`](https://github.com/apache/commons-io) from `2.15.0` to `2.15.1`
      - Update [`org.apache.httpcomponents.client5:httpclient5`](https://github.com/apache/httpcomponents-client) from `5.3` to `5.3.1`

## 5.2.0 - January 22, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.2.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- The de-facto standard `resilience4j` implementation for the resilience API is now included by default.
  In case you are loading a different implementation of the `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy` via the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI), you should use `resilience-api` and ensure `resilience4j` is not loaded transitively.
  Alternatively, you can invoke `ResilienceDecorator.setDecorationStrategy` explicitly in your code.
  - In case you are using custom facade implementations for accessors (e.g. `TenantAccessor`) this might have additional implications.

        <details>

    <summary>Details: Impact on custom facades</summary>

        First, check if all the following conditions apply for your use case:

        - You are providing a custom implementation of a facade interface (e.g. the `TenantFacade` registered to the `TenantAccessor`).
        - Your custom facade implementation uses `ThreadLocal` variables which are not configured to be passed on by the `ThreadContextExecutor`.
        - Before version `5.2.0` the `resilience4j` module was not in the dependency tree and no alternative implementation was provided.
        - You are implicitly or explicitly using a resilience configuration with a `TimeLimiter` defined.
          - This means that the `TimeLimiter` was not taking effect before `5.2.0` and respective warnings have been logged about this.
        - The code inside the resilient execution is implicitly or explicitly using the facade implementation.

        If all the above conditions apply, you might need to ensure that the `ThreadLocal` variables you are using for your custom facades are passed on by the `ThreadContextExecutor`.
        Please follow [this documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/multi-tenancy/thread-context#passing-on-other-threadlocals) on how to achieve this.

        </details>

- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationService.Cache` now enables change detection by default, but can be disabled via `DestinationService.Cache.disableChangeDetection()`.
  - `DestinationService.Cache.enableChangeDetection()` has been deprecated.

### ✨ New Functionality

- `OpenAPI` generated objects can now write custom fields which are not part of the object's schema:
  - `setCustomField("nameOfField", "valueOfField")`
- Destinations from _SAP BTP Destination Service_ with `AuthenticationType=ClientCertificateAuthentication` now support _PEM_ file format for provided key-stores.

### 📈 Improvements

- Improved the resilience module structure.
  The de-facto standard `resilience4j` implementation is now included by default.
  It is no longer necessary to explicitly reference this module in the `pom.xml`, if `resilience` is already referenced or is present transitively.
- Improved the upgrade path from SAP Cloud SDK version 4 by handling older implementations of `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy` in a graceful manner.
  In the previous releases, any occurrence of the `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:resilience4j` maven module needed to be excluded (in case it came in transitively) to not conflict with `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:resilience4j`.
  This is no longer required, as the SAP Cloud SDK 4 strategy will be ignored now, if there is exactly one alternative.
- Improved the application of resilience patterns for OAuth authorization flows.
  Stateful resilience patterns (e.g. circuit breaker) will now be applied per `client_id` of the OAuth client (was per instance of the OAuth service / destination).
- Improved the `ApacheHttpClient5CacheBuilder` API, it would return a non-public class in the previous releases.
- Dependency Updates:
  - SAP dependency updates:
    - Update the [SAP Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library) from `3.3.1` to `3.3.3`
  - Other dependency updates:
    - Update [Guava](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava/33.0.0-jre) from `32.1.3-jre` to `33.0.0-jre`
    - Update [Jackson](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core/2.16.1) from `2.15.3` to `2.16.1`
    - Update [Commons Lang](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3/3.14.0) from `3.13.0` to `3.14.0`
- Destinations retrieved from the SAP BTP Destination Service now correctly evaluate the `forwardAuthToken` property if it has the authentication type `NoAuthentication`.

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fixed an issue where adding header providers to a destination after it had already been used to obtain an `HttpClient` would not work as expected.

## 5.1.0 - December 27, 2023

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.1.0)

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- An earlier version of the [V5 Upgrade Guide](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/guides/5.0-upgrade-steps) contained an instruction to move handling of `DestinationAccessExceptions` from `DestinationAccessor.getDestination()` to `destination.getHeaders()`.
  This instruction was incorrect and has been removed.
  In case you have followed this instruction, please revert the change.
- `UriBuilder.build(scheme, userInfo, host, port, path, query, fragment)` has been deprecated in favor of `UriBuilder.build(scheme, authority, path, query, fragment)`.
- Deprecate the strategies `LOOKUP_ONLY` and `LOOKUP_THEN_EXCHANGE` of `DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy`.
  They are replaced by the `FORWARD_USER_TOKEN` strategy.
  If there are any issues when using `FORWARD_USER_TOKEN` for destinations that require user tokens, please report them and use `EXCHANGE_ONLY` for such cases.
- `DestinationService.tryGetAllDestinations()` and `DestinationService.tryGetAllDestinations(DestinationOptions opts)` have been deprecated in favor of `DestinationService.getAllDestinationProperties()`.

### ✨ New Functionality

- Added new API to retrieve destination properties only from the SAP BTP Destination Service.
  `DestinationService` now offers `getDestinationProperties(String destinationName)` and `getAllDestinationProperties()`.

### 📈 Improvements

- A warning is now logged when destinations with expired authentication tokens are used for requests.
- SAP dependency updates:
  - Update the [SAP Security Library](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library) from `3.3.0` to `3.3.1`
- Other dependency updates:
  - Update [Apache HttpClient 5](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.httpcomponents.client5/httpclient5) from `5.2.1` to `5.3`
  - Update [Apache HttpCore 5](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:httpcore5) from `5.2.3` to `5.2.4`

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where an invalid hostname in a destination would lead to an empty hostname. The hostname is now accepted.
- Fix an issue where errors from token flows of destinations retrieved from the SAP BTP destination service were not handled consistently.
  For the non-default strategy `LOOKUP_ONLY` errors were handled too late and results would get cached unintentionally.

  Please refer to the [Upgrade Guide](../guides/5.0-upgrade-steps.mdx) for the full list of module changes.

### API Changes

#### Changes to the overall Destination API:

- Both `HttpDestination` as well as `HttpDestinationProperties` are now sub-types of `Destination` for improved compatibility with the SAP Cloud SDK APIs.
- The `Destination#decorate` method has been removed without replacement.
- The public constructor of `DefaultHttpDestination` has been replaced with a static factory method `DefaultHttpDestination#fromProperties`.
  - We also added some extra static factory methods (`DefaultHttpDestination#fromMap` and `DefaultHttpDestination#fromDestination`) for convenience.
- The public constructor of `DefaultDestination` has been replaced with a static factory method `DefaultHttpDestination#fromMap`.
  - We also added an extra static factory method `DefaultHttpDestination#fromProperties` for convenience.
- The `DefaultHttpDestination.Builder` has been modified in the following ways:
  - The `user(String)` and `password(String)` methods have been replaced with `basicCredentials(String, String)`.
  - Using any overload of `basicCredentials` will now automatically set the `AuthenticationType` to `BASIC_AUTHENTICATION`.
  - Using `proxyConfiguration(ProxyConfiguration)` will now throw an `IllegalArgumentException` in case the contained `Credentials` are not supported. Supported types are `BearerCredentials` and `NoCredentials`.
- Changed the following `DestinationPropertyKey` instances:
  - `AUTH_TYPE`: `authentication` -> `Authentication`
  - `CERTIFICATES`: `certificates` -> `cloudsdk.certificates`
  - `AUTH_TOKENS`: `authTokens` -> `cloudsdk.authTokens`
  - These changes are most relevant for users who are **not** already using these constant `DestinationPropertyKey` instances but instead retrieved properties from `DestinationProperties` (and sub-types) using the `get(String, Function)` method.
- The deprecated `ClientCredentialsHttpDestination` has been removed in favor of the improved `OAuth2DestinationBuilder`.
  - The `OAuth2DestinationBuilder` has been changed to allow for setting arbitrary destination properties after the OAuth2 configuration has been set.
  - The `.withProperties(..)` aspect of the builder has been replaced with `.withProperty(..)`.
- The `BearerCredentials` behavior has been adjusted slightly: The `getToken()` method no longer just returns the value passed in via the constructor but instead is now guaranteed to **NOT** contain the prefix `"Bearer "`.
  To compensate this change, the `#getHttpHeaderValue()` method has been added, which is guaranteed to contain the `"Bearer "` prefix.

#### Changes related to the SAP BTP Destination Service:

- The `ScpCfDestination` and `ScpCfHttpDestination` classes are replaced by the baseline `Destination` and `DefaultHttpDestination` implementations.
- The `ScpCfDestinationLoader` has been renamed to `DestinationService`.
  All related classes have been renamed similarly:
  - `ScpCfDestinationRetrievalStrategy` -> `DestinationServiceRetrievalStrategy`
    - The deprecated `CURRENT_TENANT_THEN_PROVIDER` has been removed.
  - `ScpCfDestinationTokenExchangeStrategy` -> `DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy`
  - `ScpCfDestinationServiceV1Response` -> `DestinationServiceV1Response`
- Removed the following elements from enum `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.AuthenticationType`:
  - `APP_TO_APP_SSO`
  - `INTERNAL_SYSTEM_AUTHENTICATION`

#### Changes to HTTP clients:

- The `HttpClientAccessor` and `ApacheHttpClient5Accessor` classes are generalised to accept `Destination` instances, making invocations to `.asHttp()` superfluous when obtaining HTTP clients.
- The `getSslContext()` method was removed from the `CloudPlatform` interface and the implementation was moved to the modules `connectivity-apache-httpclient4` and `connectivity-apache-httpclient5`.

#### Changes to Multi-Tenancy APIs:

- The public constructor of `DefaultPrincipal` now only accepts a String argument for `principalId`.
- The `PrincipalFacade` of the `PrincipalAccessor` will default to `DefaultPrincipalFacade` in the case that a facade cannot be found.
- The `RequestHeaderContainer` no longer splits header values.
- The `ODataRequestResult` no longer splits header values.
- The `AuthTokenFacade` of the `AuthTokenAccessor` will default to `DefaultAuthTokenFacade`
- The `TenantFacade` of the `TenantAccessor` will default to `DefaultTenantFacade`
- The `TenantWithSubdomain#getSubdomain` is now `@Nullable`.

#### Changes to the SAP Cloud Platform API:

- The `CloudPlatform` interface and all related classes have been removed.
  In particular, the following classes have been removed:
  - `ScpCfCloudPlatform` and `ScpNeoCloudPlatform`
  - `CloudPlatformAccessor` and `CloudPlatformFacade`

### Maven Module Changes

- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:scp-cf` has been deprecated. Please use `com.sap.cloud.sdk:sdk-core` instead.
- All classes related to the Apache Http Client 4 have been moved from `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:cloudplatform-connectivity` to a new module `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:connectivity-apache-httpclient4`.
- All classes related to the Apache Http Client 5 have been moved from `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:apache-httpclient5` to `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:connectivity-apache-httpclient5`.
- All classes related to Resilience4j have been moved from `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:resilience4j` to `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:resilience4j`.
- All classes related to OAuth authorization flows have been moved into a new module `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:connectivity-oauth2`.
- The `cloudplatform-connectivity-scp-cf` module got renamed to `connectivity-destination-service`.
  - To prevent breaking changes with the renamed module the `cloudplatform-connectivity-scp-cf` module is still available as a dependency, but it is empty and just contains a reference to the new module `connectivity-destination-service`.
- All modules related to the SAP BTP Neo Environment have been removed.
- All modules with suffixes `-scp-cf` have been merged into their respective baseline modules:
  - `tenant-scp-cf` has been merged into `tenant`
  - `security-scp-cf` has been merged into `security`
- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:servlet` and `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:security-servlet` have been removed.
- All deprecated pre-generated clients for OData and OpenAPI have been removed:
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-all`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata-onpremise`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata-v4`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.s4hana:s4hana-api-odata-v4-onpremise`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:scp-workflow-cf`
  - `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services:btp-business-rules`

### Major Dependency Changes

- Upgrade the [SAP BTP Security Libraries](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-services-integration-library) (`com.sap.cloud.security`) from `2.14.2` to `3.3.0`.
- Upgrade [Spring](https://spring.io) (`org.springframework`) from `5.3.29` to `6.1.1`.
- Upgrade [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org) (`org.slf4j`) from `1.7.36` to `2.0.9`.
- Upgrade [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) (`com.github.ben-manes.caffeine`) from `2.9.3` to `3.1.8`.
- Change the servlet integration to the [Jakarta](https://jakarta.ee) namespace (`jakarta.servlet`).
- The overall dependency footprint of the SAP Cloud SDK has been reduced significantly.
  - This also means that some dependencies have been removed from the `sdk-bom`.

### Other Improvements

- The `Destination#asHttp()` and `Destination#asRfc()` methods no longer always return a new instance of `HttpDestination` and `RfcDestination` if the current objects is already a `HttpDestination` or `RfcDestination` respectively.
- The OData, OpenAPI and SOAP APIs are generalised to accept instances of `Destination`, making invocations to `.asHttp()` superfluous when executing OData or REST requests.
  - OData v2 and OpenAPI clients need to be re-generated to adjust for this change.
- `Destination#asHttp()` no longer throws an exception in case the `Destination` originates from the Destination service and the attached auth token contains an error.
  Instead, an exception will be thrown upon invoking the `getHeaders()` method, for example, during request execution.
- Loading a `Destination` from the SAP BTP Destination service will now:
  - No longer eagerly evaluate authentication tokens or On-Premise related headers (if applicable).
    Instead, those will be evaluated lazily upon request execution.
    As a consequence, the `getHeaders` method might now throw an exception if resolving (on-premise) authentication information fails.
  - Throw an exception if the tenant changed between loading and using the destination to execute requests.
  - Throw an exception if any of the attached certificates isn't valid.
- Removed the `javax.inject.Named` annotation from code generated with any of the OData generators (v2, v4).

### Fixed Issues

- Fixed a bug where an `Authorization` header was attached multiple times to outgoing HTTP requests under some circumstances
- Fixed an issue where the `DestinationType` of an `DefaultHttpDestination` could be changed to anything but `DestinationType.HTTP`
- Fixed an issue with custom GSON serialization of OpenAPI generated classes having unexpected `customFieldNames` properties in JSON payload.
