[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.16.0)

### ‚ú® New Functionality

- Add experimental support for updating nested fields in OData v2 complex types via PATCH requests
  - Use optional argument `FluentHelperUpdate#modifyingEntity( ModifyPatchStrategy )` to control updates with delta or full complex property payloads.

### üìà Improvements

- Improve the OData v4 class `BatchRequestBuilder` to now also implement the `ModificationRequestBuilder` interface.

### üêõ Fixed Issues

  Previously they would result in model classes extending `HashMap`, which disabled proper deserialization and serialization.

## 5.15.0 - December 19, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.15.0)

### ‚ú® New Functionality

### üìà Improvements

- Stabilize most of the remaining experimental APIs without changes, e.g.
  - RequestHeaderAccessor
  - ServiceBindingDestinationLoader
- OData v2 and v4 generators now use `LinkedHashMap` for the properties of the generated classes to maintain the order of the properties.

### üêõ Fixed Issues

- Fix ApacheHttpClient5Wrapper to propagate the configuration to Spring RestTemplate.
- Fix OData v2 and v4 generators to work when property name is `value` or `values` and is of collection type.
  - The internal variable is now respectively `cloudSdkValue` or `cloudSdkValues` to avoid conflicts with the `value` or `values` property.
