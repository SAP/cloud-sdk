## 4.15.0 - May 26, 2023

[Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=com.sap.cloud.sdk%2520v%253A4.15.0)

### Compatibility Notes

- The behaviour of `DestinationAccessor.getDestination(...)` has been changed to throw:
  - `DestinationNotFoundException` instead of `DestinationAccessException` with cause `DestinationNotFoundException` when a destination is not found
  - `DestinationAccessException` instead of `DestinationNotFoundException` when no adapters are declared
- We are planning to discontinue support of Business Logging APIs with SAP Cloud SDK v5 by end of the year.
  Therefore, we're announcing module deprecation in advance.
  The following modules and namespaces are deprecated while still being fully functional and considered supported in SAP
  Cloud SDK v4:
  - **BTP Business Logging Core**: `com.sap.cloud.sdk.services.scp.businesslogging.core.*`
    - `tryGetDestination("destinationName", CLIENT_CREDENTIALS)` is replaced by
      `ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.getDestinationForService(BUSINESS_LOGGING, "destinationName")`
    - `tryGetDestination("destinationName", USER_TOKEN)` is replaced by
      `ScpCfServiceDestinationLoader.getDestinationForService(BUSINESS_LOGGING, "destinationName", OnBehalfOf.NAMED_USER_CURRENT_TENANT)`
- Rename references from _SAP API Business Hub_ to _SAP Business Accelerator Hub_ in JavaDoc.

### New Functionality

- `OpenAPI` generated objects can now read custom fields which are not part of the object's schema:
  - `getCustomFieldNames()`
  - `getCustomField("nameOfField")`
- The BTP CloudFoundry specific platform modules now support mTLS for communication with destinations having their `securityConfigurationStrategy` set to `FROM_PLATFORM`.

### Improvements

- Dependency Updates:
  - Minor version updates:
    - Update `commons-io:commons-io` from `2.11.0` to `2.12.0`
    - Update Jackson related dependencies from `2.15.0` to `2.15.1`
    - Update `org.checkerframework:checker-qual` declared for dependency convergence from `3.33.0` to `3.34.0`
    - Update `com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations` declared for dependency convergence from `2.18.0` to `2.19.1`
    - Update `com.google.api:api-common` used in the `blockchain-client-fabric` module from `2.9.0` to `2.10.0`
- To avoid running into connection leaks while re-using the same `HttpClient` to execute multiple OData batch requests, running batch requests with `try-with-resources` construct is now possible for both OData v2 and v4 clients.

```java
  //Suggestive example for OData v2
  try(
      BatchResponse result = service.batch().addReadOperations(readOperation).executeRequest(dest)
   ) {
      return result.get(0);
  }
```

### Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where batch requests would leave open connections even after a `BatchResponse` was fully consumed.
