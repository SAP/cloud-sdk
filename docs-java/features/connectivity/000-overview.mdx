The SAP Cloud SDK offers a variety of connectivity features that help to connect to systems and services.
At its core, the SAP Cloud SDK uses [`Destination` objects](#accessing-destinations) as an abstraction of (remote) services.

Ultimately, a `Destination` will be converted into an [HTTP Client](http-client) that can be used to actually send requests to the target.
Hereby, the SAP Cloud SDK supports both cloud and [on-premise targets](on-premise).

Furthermore, the SAP Cloud SDK also offers various means of running and testing applications that use these connectivity features [in non-productive environments](running-locally), such as in an CI/CD pipeline.
That way, you are well equipped to develop robust and reliable applications.

## Accessing Destinations

A **destination** is an abstraction of a real system or service that applications may want to connect to.
It is a representation of the connection details, such as the URL, authentication, proxy settings, and HTTP headers.
The **destination** concept is an integral part of the SAP Cloud SDK for Java.

The SAP Cloud SDK offers APIs to load destinations from following sources:

- From the [BTP Destination Service on Cloud Foundry](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_CF_Connectivity_Destination/overview).
  - Via the [`DestinationAccessor` API](btp-destination-service)
- From [Service Bindings](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access/wiki/Fundamentals#service-binding).
  - Via the [`ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API](service-bindings)
- From existing `Destination` objects.
  - Via the [`DefaultHttpDestination` API](http-destinations)

## Using Destinations

Once a [`Destination`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/Destination.html) has been retrieved, it can be used to connect to the system or service it represents.
This is done by converting the given `Destination` into an HTTP client, which is then used to send requests to the system or service.

### For OData and OpenApi Services

While the `Destination` to HTTP client conversion [can be done explicitly](#for-other-services) to connect to any system or service, the SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient integrations in generated [OData](../odata/vdm-generator) and [OpenApi](../rest/generate-rest-client) clients.

<Tabs defaultValue="odatav4" values={[ { label: "OData V4 Example", value: "odatav4" }, { label: "OData V2 Example", value: "odatav2"}, { label: "OpenApi Example", value: "openapi" }]}>

<TabItem value="odatav4">

```java
Destination myDestination;
SomeODataV4Service myService;

var serviceResponse = myService.getAllEntities().execute(myDestination);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="odatav2">

```java
Destination myDestination;
SomeODataV2Service myService;

var serviceResponse = myService.getAllEntities().executeRequest(myDestination);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="openapi">

```java
Destination myDestination;

var myService = new SomeOpenApiService(myDestination);
var serviceResponse = myService.entitiesGet();
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

When running code as above, the SAP Cloud SDK internally takes care of converting the provided `Destination` into a suitable HTTP client.
This process is fully transparent to the user and has proven to be sufficient for almost all use cases.

### For Other Services

If the [above approach](#for-odata-and-openapi-services) is not applicable, the `Destination` to HTTP client conversion can be done explicitly as [described here](http-client).

### To Read Its Configuration

A `Destination` consists of a set of properties that describe the connection details of the represented system or service.
These properties can be read from the `Destination` object as follows:

```java
Destination myDestination;

String destinationName = myDestination.get(DestinationProperty.NAME).getOrElse("");
```

Reading those properties is most useful when a `Destination` is retrieved [from the BTP Destination Service](btp-destination-service), as it allows to read the properties that have been provided by a user via the BTP Cockpit.

Please refer to [this documentation](btp-destination-service#if-authentication-is-not-required) for more details.
