The SAP Cloud SDK supports connecting to arbitrary services that are bound to an application via a service binding.
[_Service Bindings_](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access/wiki/Fundamentals#service-binding) provide an application with the necessary credentials to connect to a service when deployed on the SAP Business Technology Platform.

## Connecting to a Service

You can obtain a `Destination` to connect to a service by using the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API:

```java
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.<MY_SERVICE>)
        .build();

HttpDestination destination = ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.defaultLoaderChain()
        .getDestination(options);
```

Choose from the available `ServiceIdentifier` [constants](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access/blob/main/api-parent/core-api/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/environment/servicebinding/api/ServiceIdentifier.java) to specify the service you want to connect to.

For example, for connecting to the [Workflow REST API](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_CF/overview) use:

```java {2-3}
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.WORKFLOW)
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.WorkflowOptions.REST_API)
        .build();

HttpDestination destination = ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.defaultLoaderChain()
        .getDestination(options);
```

Note the additional option `BtpServiceOptions.WorkflowOptions.REST_API` that is specific to the [Workflow API (REST)](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_CF/overview).
This is an example where the service offers multiple API endpoints and you need to define which endpoint the resulting `HttpDestination` should point to.

Explore the [BtpServiceOptions](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/BtpServiceOptions.html) class to find the options relevant for your service and your use-case.

</details>

:::tip Your service is not in the list?

In case the service you want to connect to is not yet recognized by the SAP Cloud SDK by default, you can still use the API by providing some additional information.

For services backed by the SAP Identity and Authentication Service (IAS), please see the [section on IAS](#using-the-identity-and-authentication-service-ias) below.
For other services, please refer to the section on [adding support for more services](#adding-support-for-more-services).

:::

In case you are a service provider and want to make your service compatible with the SAP Cloud SDK: Please consider contributing!

- For IAS-based services it is sufficient to conform to the dedicated [service binding format](#service-binding-format) for IAS.
- For XSUAA-based services please refer to the section on [adding support for more services](#adding-support-for-more-services) and consider adding your implementation [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/blob/main/cloudplatform/connectivity-oauth/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/BtpServicePropertySuppliers.java) by raising a pull request.

### Working with Multiple Service Bindings

In case your application is bound to multiple instances of the same service, passing the `ServiceIdentifier` is not sufficient.
Instead, you need to provide the `ServiceBinding` instance directly.

```java
var bindingList = DefaultServiceBindingAccessor.getInstance()
                .getServiceBindings();

// select the desired binding from the list of all available bindings
ServiceBinding binding = bindingList.get(0);

ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(binding)
        .build()
```

## Multitenancy and Principal Propagation

Destinations created via the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API are tenant-aware by default.
That means authorization to the target system will by default be performed on behalf of the **current tenant at the time of request execution**.

This can be customized by passing a different value for [`OnBehalfOf`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.Builder.html#onBehalfOf(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.OnBehalfOf)>).

For example, to propagate the current user to the target system use:

```java {4}
ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
    .forService(ServiceIdentifier.WORKFLOW)
    .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.WorkflowOptions.REST_API)
    .onBehalfOf(OnBehalfOf.NAMED_USER_CURRENT_TENANT)
    .build();
```

## Using the Extended Service for User and Account Authentication (XSUAA)

Communicating with SAP provided services secured by the SAP XSUAA service usually requires explicit support by the SAP Cloud SDK (see [list of supported services](#list-of-supported-services)).
This is because those services are secured by their own instance of XSUAA and, therefore, have their own authentication configuration.
The configuration is contained in the service binding of the respective service.

In scenarios where services are secured by a shared instance of the SAP XSUAA service, however, the SAP Cloud SDK can be used without explicit support:

```java {2-3} showLineNumbers
ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
    .forService(ServiceIdentifier.XSUAA)
    .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri("https://foo.com"))
    .build();
```

The code above instructs the SAP Cloud SDK to

- (Line 2) create a destination towards the XSUAA instance, which the application itself is bound to and
- (Line 3) use the manually provided URI (`https://foo.com`) as the system to communicate with.

This configuration results in a destination that uses the XSUAA instance of your application to authenticate against, but communicates with the system reachable under the provided URI.
Without the option specified in line 3, the destination would target the XSUAA instance itself.

:::note Principal Propagation with IAS

For IAS-based applications and services principal propagation requires additional configuration.
When creating the IAS service binding an additional parameter needs to be passed to enable the `jwt-bearer` grant type.
Refer to the documentation [here](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/CPSecurity/Knowledge-Base/blob/master/08_Tutorials/iasbroker/README.md#parameters) (SAP-internal).

:::

## Using the Identity and Authentication Service (IAS)

:::warning Beta API

The API for connecting to services secured by the SAP Identity and Authentication Service (IAS) is currently in beta and subject to change.

:::

In case your application is bound to an instance of the SAP Identity and Authentication Service (IAS) you can use the SAP Cloud SDK to connect to other applications and services that are secured using IAS.
Effectively, the SAP Cloud SDK implements the OAuth flows described [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/consume-apis-from-other-applications).

:::info Supported Credential Types

The SAP Cloud SDK supports the credential types `binding-secret`, `X509_GENERATED` and `X509_ATTESTED` for IAS service bindings.

If you want to use the `X509_ATTESTED` credential type, you need to add the `connectivity-ztis` dependency to your project.
Read more about how to configure your app for this credential type on the documentation for [using certificates from the Zero Trust Identity Service (ZTIS)](/docs/java/features/connectivity/mtls#using-automated-certificate-rotation-using-the-zero-trust-identity-service-sap-internal).

The type `X509_PROVIDED` is currently not supported.
:::

### Connecting to Services

If your service is secured using IAS and is using the dedicated [service binding format](#service-binding-format) supported by the SAP Cloud SDK, you can obtain a destination by passing the service label as the `ServiceIdentifier`:

```java
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.of("your-service-label"))
        .build();
```

In case your service is not using the default format you can still use the `IasOptions` and `AuthenticationServiceOptions` to provide the necessary information:

```java
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION)
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri("https://foo.com"))
        .build();
```

Obtain the URL from the service binding of the service you want to connect to.

:::info Mutual TLS Only Authentication

In case the service does not require a JWT token (e.g. the Event Broker service) you can pass an additional option to skip the JWT token flow:

```java {4,5}
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION)
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri("https://foo.com"))
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.IasOptions.withoutTokenForTechnicalProviderUser())
        .onBehalfOf(OnBehalfOf.TECHNICAL_USER_PROVIDER)
        .build();
```

This is a moderate performance improvement, but not substantial, since tokens are of course cached.

Please note that this only applies when authenticating on behalf of the provider tenant using an X.509 Certificate.
For authenticating on behalf of a subscriber tenant or a when propagating user information, a JWT is always required to carry the additional tenant/user information.

:::

### Connecting to Applications

In case you want to connect to a system that is registered as an application within IAS use the `IasOptions.withApplicationName` to provide the application name:

```java {3}
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION)
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.IasOptions.withApplicationName("application-name"))
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri("https://foo.com"))
        .build();
```

### Calling Back Applications

If you received an incoming request from an application using IAS you can use the following options to create a destination for calling back the application:

```java {3}
var options = ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(ServiceIdentifier.IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION)
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.IasOptions.withConsumerClient("client-id"))
        .withOption(BtpServiceOptions.AuthenticationServiceOptions.withTargetUri("https://foo.com"))
        .build();
```

Use the client ID you received in the JWT of the incoming request.

### Service Binding Format

The SAP Cloud SDK expects services backed by IAS to have the following service binding format:

- The `credentials` section must contain an object `authentication-service` with at least one field `service-label` set to `identity`.
- The `credentials` section must contain an object `endpoints` which must contain at least one entry.
  - Each entry under `endpoints` must be an object containing a `uri` field set to a string.
- Further fields under `authentication-service` and `endpoints` are optional as shown below
- Aside from these requirements the service binding may contain any other fields as needed.

For example, the following binding would be recognized:

```json
{
  "label": "eventmesh-sap2sap-internal",
  "credentials": {
    "authentication-service": {
      "service-label": "identity"
    },
    "endpoints": {
      "eventing-endpoint": {
        "uri": "https://http-gateway.eu11.beb.em.services.cloud.sap",
        "always-requires-token": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Full format with optional fields</summary>

```jsonc
{
  // the usual binding metadata fields here
  // ...
  "credentials": {
    "authentication-service": {
      "service-label": "identity",
      "app-name": "app" // optional
    },
    "endpoints": {
      "my-endpoint": {
        "uri": "https://cert.service.com",
        // the following fields are optional and shown here with their assumed default values
        "protocol": "http",
        "always-requires-token": true,
        "requires-mtls": true
      },
      // multiple endpoints can be defined in addition
      "my-other-endpoint": {
        "uri": "https://service.com",
        "requires-mtls": false
      },
      "my-ftp-endpoint": {
        "uri": "ftp://service.com",
        "protocol": "ftp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

:::note Multiple Endpoints

Currently, the SAP Cloud SDK only supports service bindings with a single entry under `endpoints`.

:::

## Adding Support for More Services

In case you want to connect to a service that is not supported out of the box, you can still use the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API by providing some additional information.

In most cases it's sufficient to provide an implementation of `OAuth2PropertySupplier` that can extract the required information from the specific service binding.
Services backed by XSUAA typically have rather similar service binding formats that differ only slightly.
For services backed by IAS please refer to the sections above instead.

In most cases overriding the `DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier` and implementing the `getServiceUri()` method is already sufficient.

For example, assume the following binding structure:

```jsonc
{
  "label": "my-service",
  "credentials": {
    "some": {
      "json": {
        "path": "https://my-service.com/"
      }
    },
    "clientid": "my-client-id"
    // ...
  }
}
```

This could be handled by the following implementation:

```java {5,12,17}
class MyServicePropertySupplier extends DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier
{
    MyServicePropertySupplier( @Nonnull final ServiceBindingDestinationOptions options )
    {
        super(options, Collections.emptyList());
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public URI getServiceUri()
    {
        return getCredentialOrThrow(URI.class, "some", "json", "path");
    }
}

OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.registerPropertySupplier(
    ServiceIdentifier.of("my-service"), MyServicePropertySupplier::new);
```

Note that:

- Line 5 indicates that the OAuth credentials are stored directly in the `credentials` object.
- Line 12 extracts the service URI from the `credentials.some.json.path` field.
- Line 17 registers the implementation for any binding with the label `my-service`.

For more details refer to the more extensive guidance given in the [advanced section below](#customization).
Also consider the [existing implementations](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/blob/main/cloudplatform/connectivity-oauth/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/BtpServicePropertySuppliers.java) and [tests](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/blob/main/cloudplatform/connectivity-oauth/src/test/java/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplierTest.java#L60).

## Local Development

When developing locally you have various options to provide the necessary service binding information:

- When using CAP you can use the [Hybrid Testing](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/hybrid-testing#bind-to-cloud-services) feature.
- You can manually copy the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable and set it locally (e.g. in your terminal or IDE or using an IDE plugin that loads a `.env` file)
- You can define a binding programmatically in your application (e.g. in a test setup or a local development profile)

### Programmatically Defining a Service Binding

You can create a `ServiceBinding` instance programmatically and use it to create a destination:

```java
var binding = new DefaultServiceBindingBuilder()
    .withServiceIdentifier(ZTIS_IDENTIFIER)
    .withCredentials(Map.of(
         "clientid", "id",
         "url", "https://foo.com"))
    .build();
```

You can pass the binding explicitly via the options as described in the section on [working with multiple bindings](#working-with-multiple-service-bindings).

However, in some cases the SAP Cloud SDK or other frameworks may implicitly access service bindings.
For such cases one can modify the global `ServiceBindingAccessor`.

The SAP Cloud SDK will use the default instance whenever looking for service bindings.
You can override this instance:

```java
DefaultServiceBindingAccessor.setInstance(() -> List.of(binding));
```

In case you want to keep all existing bindings and just add your own you can use the following code:

```java
final ServiceBindingAccessor accessor = DefaultServiceBindingAccessor.getInstance();
var newAccessor = new ServiceBindingMerger(List.of(accessor, () -> List.of(binding)), ServiceBindingMerger.KEEP_EVERYTHING);
DefaultServiceBindingAccessor.setInstance(newAccessor);
```

## (Advanced) Background Information

In general, the [`ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.html) can be used to convert `ServiceBinding` instances into `HttpDestination` instances.
It comes as part of the [`cloudplatform-connectivity` artifact](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/cloudplatform-connectivity).

The API is designed for easy extensibility and customization.
Hereby, each `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementation is supposed to provide the transformation logic for one specific "type" of `ServiceBinding`.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides, for example, an implementation for service bindings that contain [OAuth2 credentials](#about-the-oauth2loader).

As an input, the API requires [the `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions`](#about-the-options) instance.
This class is designed to hold all information that is required to transform a `ServiceBinding` into an `HttpDestination` - this, first and foremost, includes the `ServiceBinding` itself.

Furthermore, there is also a [_chain_ implementation](#about-the-chain-implementation) that can be used to combine multiple `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementations into one.
The chain will try to load a destination using the given `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` delegates until the first of them succeeds - much like a fallback mechanism.
This concept is also reflected in the example from above, where the `defaultLoaderChain` is used to load a destination.

### About the _Options_

The [`ServiceBindingDestinationOptions`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.html) is an **extensible and type-safe** collection of parameters that can be used to configure the `ServiceBinding` to `HttpDestination` transformation process.
Hereby, the least information that is needed is the `ServiceBinding` itself, which can be provided using the [`forService(ServiceBinding)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.html#forService(com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding.api.ServiceBinding)>) method.

Alternatively, you can also use [`forService(ServiceIdentifier)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.html#forService(com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding.api.ServiceIdentifier)>).
This method will try to find a `ServiceBinding` for the given `ServiceIdentifier` using the [`DefaultServiceBindingAccessor` instance](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access/blob/main/api-parent/access-api/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/environment/servicebinding/api/DefaultServiceBindingAccessor.java). <br />
**Please note:** If there are multiple or no `ServiceBinding`s for the given `ServiceIdentifier`, an exception will be thrown.

Besides the `ServiceBinding`, there is a second parameter that is shared between all `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementations: The `OnBehalfOf`, for which the destination should be loaded.
This can be set using the [`onBehalfOf(OnBehalfOf)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.Builder.html#onBehalfOf(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.OnBehalfOf)>) method. <br />
If not explicitly specified, `OnBehalfOf.TECHNICAL_USER_CURRENT_TENANT` is used.

### Custom Parameters

Adding custom parameters to the `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` can be done using the [`withOption(OptionsEnhancer)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.Builder.html#withOption(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.OptionsEnhancer)>) method.
Hereby, an [`OptionsEnhancer`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.OptionsEnhancer.html) is a type-safe representation of arbitrary parameters.

<details>
<summary>Example: Custom Service Binding Transformation</summary>

:::tip Advanced Usage

The following example demonstrates rather advanced usage of our `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API.

A vast majority of use cases do not require a custom `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementation. <br />
Instead, customizing the existing `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` as [described below](#customization) is most probably sufficient.

:::

Lets assume we are providing a custom `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementation that requires some additional information to be able to transform a `ServiceBinding` into an `HttpDestination`.

In this example, we assume that there are two different APIs for our service.
Depending on which API we want to create our `HttpDestination` for, we need to slightly alter the transformation logic.
Additionally, we want to be able to supply an additional `String` parameter that also affects the created `HttpDestination`.

To achieve this behavior, we would need to implement two `OptionsEnhancer`s like so:

```java title="MyApiChoice.java" showLineNumbers
enum MyApiChoice implements ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.OptionsEnhancer<MyApiChoice> {
    API1,
    API2;

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public MyApiChoice getValue() {
        return this;
    }
}
```

```java title="MyStringParameter.java" showLineNumbers
class MyStringParameter implements ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.OptionsEnhancer<String> {
    private final String value;

    public static MyStringParameter of(String value) {
        return new MyStringParameter(value);
    }

    private MyStringParameter(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

The first implementation uses an `enum` to implement a **fixed set of choices** option.
It is noteworthy that the actual parameter type is the `MyApiChoice` enum itself.
That way, we will be able to retrieve the set value later on.

In contrast to that, the second implementation provides a `String` parameter.

Setting the options can then be done like so:

```java
ServiceBinding someServiceBinding;

ServiceBindingDestinationOptions
        .forService(someServiceBinding)
        .withOption(MyApiChoice.API1)
        .withOption(MyStringParameter.of("some-value"))
        .build();
```

Finally, we can implement our custom `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` that uses our new options like so:

```java title="MyCustomServiceBindingLoader.java" showLineNumbers
class MyCustomServiceBindingLoader implements ServiceBindingDestinationLoader
{
    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public Try<HttpDestination> tryGetDestination( @Nonnull ServiceBindingDestinationOptions options )
    {
        Option<MyApiChoice> maybeOption = options.getOption(MyApiChoice.class);
        if( maybeOption.isEmpty() ) {
            return Try.failure(new DestinationNotFoundException("No API choice was specified."));
        }

        Option<String> maybeStringValue = options.getOption(MyStringParameter.class);

        MyApiChoice option = maybeOption.get();
        switch( option ) {
            case API1:
                // do something
                break;
            case API2:
                // do something else
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

### About the _OAuth2Loader_

The [`OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.html) comes as part of the [`connectivity-oauth` artifact](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/connectivity-oauth) and provides a customizable implementation for converting `ServiceBinding`s that use OAuth2 authentication into `HttpDestination` instances. <br />
More precisely, it supports the **OAuth2 Client Credentials** and **OAuth2 JWT Bearer** grant types.

Internally, the implementation performs the following steps:

1. Check whether the given `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` can be transformed (e.g. whether the `ServiceBinding` has a `clientid`).
2. Extract the required information from the `ServiceBinding` (i.e. the service URL, the token URL, and the client identity).
3. Assemble an `HttpDestination` that uses the extracted information for the **target authentication** (i.e. HTTP header `Authorization`).

### Dealing With Arbitrary Service Bindings

Even though **service bindings** are a fundamental concept in the SAP Business Technology Platform, the way they are used and structured can **vary greatly from service to service**.
As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a uniform way of dealing with arbitrary `ServiceBinding`s. <br />
Therefore, the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` leverages the [`OAuth2PropertySupplier`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/OAuth2PropertySupplier.html) interface to extract the required information from a given `ServiceBindingDestinationLoaderOptions` instance.

The `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` stores a **static list** of `OAuth2PropertySupplier` instances.
Whenever the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` is asked to load a destination, it will iterate over this list (**in order**) to see whether

1. the given `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` can be transformed into an `HttpDestination` using the current `OAuth2PropertySupplier` instance, and, if so
2. extract the required information from the given `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` using the current `OAuth2PropertySupplier`.

By default, there are `OAuth2PropertySupplier` for the services [mentioned above](#list-of-supported-services) in place.

### Customization

In case the default configuration of the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` does not fit your needs, you can customize it by adding your own `OAuth2PropertySupplier` instances to the static list of the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader`:

```java
OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.registerPropertySupplier(this::canBeConverted, this::propertySupplierFactory);

boolean canBeConverted(ServiceBindingDestinationOptions options);
OAuth2PropertySupplier propertySupplierFactory(ServiceBindingDestinationOptions options);
```

As shown above, the [`registerPropertySupplier`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.html#registerPropertySupplier(java.util.function.Predicate,java.util.function.Function)>) method takes two methods as parameters.
This might be unintuitive, but is needed to allow for efficient implementations.

What is happening internally when this method is used, is that the given parameters are transformed into an internal representation, which is then **prepended** to the list of available `OAuth2PropertySupplier` instances.
In other words: Using the `registerPropertySupplier` method will make your `OAuth2PropertySupplier` instance be considered **before** any previously registered `OAuth2PropertySupplier` instance, including the default ones.

To make things a bit more concrete, let's assume we wanted to implement support for an other service, which uses its own `ServiceBinding` structure.

Our hypothetical service binding could look like this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "service": "my-service",
  "credentials": {
    "service": {
      "read": "https://my-service.com/api/v1/read",
      "write": "https://my-service.com/api/v2/write"
    },
    "oauth": {
      "uri": "https://my-service.com/oauth/token",
      "id": "my-client-id",
      "secret": "my-client-secret"
    }
  }
}
```

The service binding above contains two different API endpoints (`read` and `write`), which we would like to be able to access using the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader`.
To support that, we need to implement an `OAuth2PropertySupplier` (to implement the property extraction logic) and an `OptionsEnhancer` (to allow users to define which endpoint they would like to use):

```java title="MyApiEndpoint.java" showLineNumbers
enum MyApiEndpoint implements ServiceBindingDestinationOptions.OptionsEnhancer<MyApiEndpoint> {
    READ,
    WRITE;

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public MyApiEndpoint getValue() {
        return this;
    }
}
```

```java title="MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier.java" showLineNumbers
class MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier extends DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier
{
    public MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier(ServiceBindingDestinationOptions options) {
        super(options, Collections.singletonList("oauth"));
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isOAuth2Binding() {
        return getOAuthCredential(String.class, "id").isDefined();
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public URI getServiceUri() {
        MyApiEndpoint endpoint = options.getOption(MyApiEndpoint.class).getOrElse(MyApiEndpoint.READ);
        return switch (endpoint) {
            case READ -> getCredentialOrThrow(URI.class, "service", "read");
            case WRITE -> getCredentialOrThrow(URI.class, "service", "write");
        };
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public URI getTokenUri() {
        return getOAuthCredentialOrThrow(URI.class, "uri");
    }

    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public ClientIdentity getClientIdentity() {
        var clientId = getOAuthCredentialOrThrow(String.class, "id");
        var clientSecret = getOAuthCredentialOrThrow(String.class, "secret");
        return new ClientCredentials(clientId, clientSecret);
    }
}
```

Lets examine the implementation above:

Right in the first line, you can see that our implementation extends the [`DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier.html) class, instead of implementing the `OAuth2PropertySupplier` interface directly. <br />
This is because the `DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier` class provides a lot of useful functionality, which we can reuse in our implementation. <br />
We will see that in a second.

Next thing we should pay attention to is the constructor of our class. <br />
It takes an instance of `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` as a parameter.
This instance is then passed to the `super` constructor (line 4) along with a list of `String`s.

The super class (`DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier`) uses these parameters to

1. cache the _credentials_ portion of the `ServiceBinding` (given in the `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions`) as a [`TypedMapView` instance](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access/blob/main/api-parent/consumption-api/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/environment/servicebinding/api/TypedMapView.java) and
2. set the _default oauth2 properties path_ **within** the _credentials_ portion of the `ServiceBinding`.

Converting the _credentials_ portion of the `ServiceBinding` into a `TypedMapView` is helpful for parsing the nested structure. <br />
Therefore, it is a good idea to do the conversion (i.e. `TypeMapView.ofCredentials(ServiceBinding)`) just once as it performs an expensive deep-copy.
Hereby, the `DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier` takes care of doing the conversion upon initialization and caching the result for later use.

Further down in our code (i.e. within the overridden methods), we can then use the [`getCredential/OrThrow`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier.html#getCredential(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String...)>) and [`getOAuthCredential/OrThrow`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier.html#getOAuthCredential(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String...)>) methods to extract the required information from the cached _credentials_. <br />
The main difference between `getCredential` and `getOAuthCredential` is that the latter will **prepend** the _default oauth2 properties path_ to the one given in the method invocation before trying to extract the information. <br />
In our example (line 9), this means that `getOAuthCredential(String.class, "id")` will try to extract a `String` value from `credentials.get("oauth").get("id")` (_pseudo code_). <br />
In contrast to that, using just `getCredential(String.class, "id")` would try to extract a `String` value from `credentials.get("id")` (_pseudo code_). <br />
`getOAuthCredential` is therefore just a neat shortcut that can help to reduce repetitive code.

Please note how we are handling our `MyApiEndpoint` option in the `getServiceUri` method (lines 14 - 20). <br />
We are reading the option by providing the `MyApiEndpoint.class` as the parameter to the `getOption` method.
That way, we can decide which service URI to use, depending on the user input.

Lastly, we need to register our `OAuth2PropertySupplier` implementation with the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader`:

```java title="MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier.java" showLineNumbers
class MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier extends DefaultOAuth2PropertySupplier {
    private static final ServiceIdentifier MY_SERVICE_IDENTIFIER = ServiceIdentifier.of("my-service");

    public static boolean matches(ServiceBindingDestinationOptions options) {
        var serviceIdentifier = options.getServiceBinding().getServiceIdentifier().orElse(null);
        return MY_SERVICE_IDENTIFIER.equals(serviceIdentifier);
    }

    // skipped for brevity
}

OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.registerPropertySupplier(MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier::matches, MyServiceOAuth2PropertySupplier::new);
```

In the above example, we added a static `matches` method (lines 4 - 7) to our `OAuth2PropertySupplier` implementation, which we can use to check whether the given `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` can be transformed into an `HttpDestination` using our implementation.
We are then using method references to register our implementation with the `OAuth2ServiceBindingDestinationLoader`.

### About the Chain Implementation

As mentioned [above](#how-it-works), the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` comes with a private _chain_ implementation.

The default instance of that chain (`ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.defaultLoaderChain`) is created using the _Service Locator Pattern_ to find all available `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementations on the classpath.
Instances of these implementations are then used as delegate loaders.
When transforming a `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions` into an `HttpDestination`, the chain will invoke the delegates **in order** until the first one either succeeds or throws an exception other than `DestinationNotFoundException`.

:::info

The _Service Locator Pattern_ does not provide any guarantees about the order in which implementations on the classpath are found.
Therefore, it is **crucial** that `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` implementations do **not handle the same `ServiceBindingDestinationOptions`** as otherwise the default chain's behavior would be **unpredictable**.

Implementations provided by the SAP Cloud SDK follow this rule.

:::

#### Custom Chain Instances

If the default chain implementation does not meet your needs, you can create your own chain instance:

```java
ServiceBindingDestinationLoader myChain = ServiceBindingDestinationLoader.newLoaderChain(
        Arrays.asList(
                new MyFirstLoader(),
                new MySecondLoader()
        ));
```

The code above initializes a new instance of the private chain implementation, which uses the given `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` instances **in the specified order** as its delegates.
Therefore, deterministic behavior is guaranteed.
