The SAP Cloud SDK offers basic functionality that helps with connecting to other systems and services like SAP S/4HANA Cloud or On-premise edition.
The SAP Cloud SDK leverages the existing API of `HttpClient` and applies conveniently managed properties, e.g. according to a specific destination configuration.
In the following paragraphs, the `HttpClientAccessor` API and its usage will be described.

## General Usage

In general an `HttpClient` can be instantiated through the `HttpClientAcessor`.
The SAP Cloud SDK itself uses the accessor class for all internal requests as well.

<Tabs 
  groupId="http-client"
  defaultValue="v4"
  values={[
    {label: "Apache Version 4.x", value: "v4"},
    {label: "Apache Version 5.x", value: "v5"}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="v4">

To make use the `HttpClientAccessor`, make sure to include the [cloudplatform-connectivity](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform%2BAND%2Ba:cloudplatform-connectivity) dependency in your project.

```java
HttpClient client = HttpClientAccessor.getHttpClient();
```

If you need an `HttpClient` to reach a system that has been configured as a Destination (e.g. an On-premise S/4HANA system), you may first fetch the destination and then use it as a argument for the accessor:

```java
Destination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");
HttpClient client = HttpClientAccessor.getHttpClient(destination);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="v5">

:::caution BETA API

All APIs related to the Apache version 5 `HttpClient` are currently in `Beta`, i.e. they are experimental and might be changed at any time.

:::

To make use the `ApacheHttpClient5Accessor`, make sure to include the [cloudplatform-connectivity](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform%2BAND%2Ba:cloudplatform-connectivity) **and** the [apache-httpclient5](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks%2BAND%2Ba:apache-httpclient5) dependencies in your project.

```java
HttpClient client = ApacheHttpClient5Accessor.getHttpClient();
```

If you need an `HttpClient` to reach a system that has been configured as a Destination (e.g. an On-premise S/4HANA system), you may first fetch the destination and then use it as a argument for the accessor:

```java
Destination destination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");
HttpClient client = ApacheHttpClient5Accessor.getHttpClient(destination);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When using a destination, the configured destination URL will be used as base path for the subsequent requests for `client`.

:::note
Please note that similar to other accessor-based APIs, the SAP Cloud SDK offers methods with a `try` prefix to allow for optional VAVR-enhanced API access.
:::

## Customization

When the properties of `HttpClient` are not working for the application, e.g. timeout is too short or too long, then the generation can be customized.
Please find the `HttpClientFactory` interface.
They offer a similar method `createHttpClient` with optional destination argument:

<Tabs 
  groupId="http-client"
  defaultValue="v4"
  values={[
    {label: "Apache Version 4.x", value: "v4"},
    {label: "Apache Version 5.x", value: "v5"}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="v4">

```java
HttpClientFactory factory = new DefaultHttpClientFactory();

HttpClient genericClient = factory.createHttpClient();
HttpClient destinationClient = factory.createHttpClient(destination);
```

The `DefaultHttpClientFactory` type offers a static builder, to enable custom properties for:

- `timeoutMilliseconds`
- `maxConnectionsPerRoute`
- `maxConnectionsTotal`

```java
HttpClientFactory customFactory = DefaultHttpClientFactory.builder()
  .timeoutMilliseconds(60000)
  .maxConnectionsPerRoute(100)
  .maxConnectionsTotal(200)
  .build();
```

When inheriting from `DefaultHttpClientFactory` it's possible to provide even deeper customization:

```java
DefaultHttpClientFactory customFactory = new DefaultHttpClientFactory() {
  @Override
  protected RequestConfig.Builder getRequestConfigBuilder( HttpDestinationProperties destination ) {
    return super.getRequestConfigBuilder(destination)
      .setProxy(new HttpHost("proxy", 8080, "http"));
  }
  @Override
  protected HttpClientBuilder getHttpClientBuilder( HttpDestinationProperties destination ) {
    return super.getHttpClientBuilder(destination)
      .setUserAgent("SDK");
  }
};
```

It is possible to take advantage of calls to `super` - or use your own objects directly.
This inheritance enables custom implementation for the following methods:

- `getHttpClientBuilder`
- `getRequestConfigBuilder`
- `getSocketConfigBuilder`
- `getConnectionManager`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="v5">

```java
ApacheHttpClient5Factory customFactory = new ApacheHttpClient5FactoryBuilder()
        .timeout(Duration.ofMinutes(1L))
        .maxConnectionsTotal(100)
        .maxConnectionsPerRoute(20)
        .build();

HttpClient genericClient = customFactory.createHttpClient();
HttpClient destinationClient = customFactory.createHttpClient(destination);
```

The builder class (`ApacheHttpClient5FactoryBuilder`) provides the following customization options:

1. `Duration timeout` - The timeout that should be used by `HttpClient` instances created by the to-be-built `ApacheHttpClient5Factory`.
   This timeout applies to the following concerns:
   - Connection timeout: The time to establish the connection with the remote host.
   - Socket timeout: The time to wait for data â€“ after the connection was established; maximum time of inactivity between two data packets.
   - Connection Request timeout: The time to wait when requesting a connection lease from the underlying [PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/org/apache/hc/client5/http/impl/io/PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager.html).
2. `int maxConnectionsTotal` - The maximum number of parallel connections that can be established with a `HttpClient` created by the to-be-built `ApacheHttpClient5Factory`.
3. `int maxConnectionsPerRoute` - The maximum number of parallel connections **per route** (e.g. per remote host) that can be established with a `HttpClient` created by the to-be-built `ApacheHttpClient5Factory`.

If these customization options are not enough, consider creating your own implementation of the `ApacheHttpClient5Factory`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Overriding Default Behavior

Now the customization of the HTTP client factory is available and we can adjust the default behavior for the accessor:

<Tabs 
  groupId="http-client"
  defaultValue="v4"
  values={[
    {label: "Apache Version 4.x", value: "v4"},
    {label: "Apache Version 5.x", value: "v5"}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="v4">

```java
HttpClientFactory factory = new MyCustomHttpClientFactory();
HttpClientAccessor.setHttpClientFactory(factory);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="v5">

```java
ApacheHttpClient5Factory factory = new MyCustomFactory();
ApacheHttpClient5Accessor.setHttpClientFactory(factory);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

From now on the custom factory will be used for every explicit and implicit HTTP request running through the SAP Cloud SDK.
