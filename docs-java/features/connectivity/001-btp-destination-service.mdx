The [`DestinationAccessor`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationAccessor.html) API is part of the [`cloudplatform-connectivity` artifact](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/cloudplatform-connectivity) and provides easy and convenient access to destinations that can be identified by their name.
Those are, in the vast majority of use cases, destinations managed in the [BTP Destination Service on Cloud Foundry](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_CF_Connectivity_Destination/overview).

```java
Destination myDestination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");
```

### Prerequisites

To use the `DestinationAccessor` to retrieve destinations from the BTP Destination Service on Cloud Foundry, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The [**`connectivity-destination-service` artifact**](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/connectivity-destination-service) must be on the classpath.
- There must be **_exactly_ one service binding** for the BTP Destination Service on Cloud Foundry available at runtime.

:::info Caching

Destinations retrieved from the BTP Destination Service for Cloud Foundry are [cached](#default-caching-behavior) for **5 minutes** by default.

:::

## About the `DestinationService`

Internally, the `DestinationAccessor` uses the [`DestinationService`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationService.html) class to retrieve destinations managed by the BTP Destination Service on Cloud Foundry.

It offers APIs to 

1. Retrieve [individual destinations](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationService.html#tryGetDestination(java.lang.String,com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationOptions)>) to [connect to the target system](#how-authentication-at-the-target-system-works):

```java
var service = new DestinationService();

DestinationOptions options;
Try<Destination> destination = service.tryGetDestination("my-destination", options);
```

2. Retrieve [all destinstions](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationService.html#tryGetAllDestinations(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationOptions)>) to [read destination configurations](#if-authentication-is-not-required):

```java
var service = new DestinationService();

DestinationOptions options;
Try<Iterable<Destination>> destinations = service.tryGetAllDestinations(options);
```


3. Both for [either a subscriber or the provider tenant](#multitenancy).
4. [Tweak caching behavior](#tweaking-the-caching-behavior):

```java
DestinationService.Cache.setSizeLimit(2_000L);
DestinationService.Cache.setExpiration(Duration.ofMinutes(10), CacheExpirationStrategy.WHEN_CREATED);
```


### How Authentication at the Target System Works

The BTP Destination Service on Cloud Foundry offers a broad range of authentication methods.
You can find further details about how to configured destinations in the BTP Cockpit [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/http-destinations#configuring-authentication).

When retrieving **a single** destination, the Cloud Foundry Destination Service takes over the heavy lifting of authenticating at the target system on behalf of the calling application.
Once authentication has been performed successfully, the Cloud Foundry Destination Service returns a destination configuration that contains all the information required to connect to the target system - including, for example, an `Authorization` header that can be used by the application.

As a consequence, the SAP Cloud SDK's `DestinationService` abstraction automatically supports all authentication methods offered by the Cloud Foundry Destination Service.

:::info Authentication Flows

Please keep in mind that the authentication flows are **not** executed by the SAP Cloud SDK itself.
Therefore, reusing existing `Destination` objects for longer periods of time is **not recommended** as the underlying authentication information may expire (e.g. a JWT).
Instead, `Destination` objects should be retrieved via the `DestinationLoader` (or `DestinationAccessor`) API **every time** they are needed.

Don't worry, there is [caching](#default-caching-behavior) in place to prevent excessive HTTP calls.

:::

### If Authentication Is Not Required

Sometimes, applications might be interested in reading the destination configuration without actually performing any HTTP calls.
In such scenarios, retrieving individual destinations from the BTP Destination Service is suboptimal as the service will perform the configured authentication flow, which can be a costly operation.

To prevent any unnecessary performance loss, the `DestinationService` offers an API to retrieve all destination configurations.
Hereby, **no authentication** will be performed by the BTP Destination Service for Cloud Foundry.

```java
Try<Iterable<Destination>> maybeDestinations = new DestinationService().tryGetAllDestinations();
```

#### Caution

Using any of these `Destination` instances for an actual remote system call will result in an error as the `Destination` does not contain any authentication information.

### Multitenancy

The `DestinationService` is tenant-aware by default.
This means that the `DestinationService` will, by default, perform requests on behalf of the current tenant, if a tenant is available.

The tenant and principal information is taken from the `ThreadContext` as [documented here](../multi-tenancy/thread-context).

#### Caution

If there is **no tenant available**, the `DestinationService` will **fall back to the provider tenant**.
Even though this behavior makes sense in many cases, it may not be desired in some scenarios.

Therefore, the `Destination` retrieval can be configured using the [`DestinationOptions`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationOptions.html) API.
More precisely, there are two stratgies that can be configured for the destination retrieval:

- The [`DestinationServiceRetrievalStrategy`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationServiceRetrievalStrategy.html) and
- the [`DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy.html)

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

Using these options can be done like follows:

```java
DestinationLoader loader;

DestinationOptions options =
    DestinationOptions
        .builder()
        .augmentBuilder(
            DestinationServiceOptionsAugmenter
                .augmenter()
                .retrievalStrategy(DestinationServiceRetrievalStrategy.ONLY_SUBSCRIBER))
        .augmentBuilder(
            DestinationServiceOptionsAugmenter
                .augmenter()
                .tokenExchangeStrategy(DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy.FORWARD_USER_TOKEN))
        .build();

Try<Destination> maybeDestination = loader.tryGetDestination("my-destination", options);
```

In the above code, we are configuring the `DestinationService` to only retrieve destinations from the subscriber tenant. <br />
If there is no current tenant or the current tenant is the provider, the destination retrieval will fail.

Furthermore, we are also using the `FORWARD_USER_TOKEN` strategy. <br />
This strategy will eagerly forward the current user token (e.g. JWT) to the destination service for the destination retrieval.
That way, the service is immediately able to perform the authentication flow on behalf of the user. <br />
In contrast to that, using the `LOOKUP_THEN_EXCHANGE` strategy would first retrieve the destination configuration and then perform a second HTTP request that includes the user token if the destination requires it.

Note that you need an actual instance of `DestinationLoader` (e.g. `DestinationService`) to be able to supply the `DestinationOptions`.
The `DestinationAccessor` **does not** offer this API.

</details>

## Resilience

Since the `DestinationService` is performing error prone operations (i.e. HTTP calls), it comes with some resilience mechanisms out of the box:

- (**request isolated**) _Time Limiter_ - Destination retrieval is limited to a maximum of **6 seconds**.
- (**tenant isolated**) _Circuit Breaker_ - Requests will be blocked once more than **50%** of the **last 10** requests failed.
  - For fetching **individual** destinations, the circuit breaker will stay open for **6 seconds**.
  - For fetching **all** destinations, the circuit breaker will stay open for **60 seconds**.
- (**tenant isolated**) _Bulk Head_ - The maximum number of concurrent requests is limited to **50**. Queued tasks will wait for up to **60 seconds** before being rejected.

### Tweaking Time Limiter

Even though the [default time limiter configuration](#resilience) should serve as a good starting point for many applications, it may be necessary to tweak it for specific use cases.
This can be achieved by building your own `DestinationService` instance:

```java
import static com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.resilience.ResilienceConfiguration.TimeLimiterConfiguration;

DestinationService service =
    DestinationService
        .builder()
        .withTimeLimiterConfiguration(TimeLimiterConfiguration.of(Duration.ofSeconds(30)))
        .build();
```

To apply this customized configuration for all future destination retrievals, you need to **prepend** your customized instance to the `DestinationAccessor`:

```java
DestinationAccessor.prependDestinationLoader(service);
```

## Default Caching Behavior

Besides the resilience measures explained above, the `DestinationService` also comes with a cache.
This cache stores retrieved destinations **based on tenant** and (for some scenarios) **based on user**.

_For example_:
When retrieving a destination that uses _BasicAuthentication_, using **tenant isolation** is sufficient as all users share the same credentials.
However, when retrieving a destination that uses _OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion_ authentication, the destination is isolated **based on tenant and user**.

Once cached, entries will be stored for **up to 5 minutes**, where destinations that use JWT-based authentication may expire earlier.
Additionally, the cache is configured to store only the **1000 latest entries _across all tenants_**.
This is to prevent excessive memory usage in case of a large number of tenants and/or destinations.

### Tweaking the Caching Behavior

Even though the [default caching behavior](#default-caching-behavior) should serve as a good starting point for many applications, it may be necessary to tweak it for specific use cases.
For that, the [`DestinationService.Cache`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationService.Cache.html) offers a number of configuration APIs ([JavaDoc](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationService.Cache.html)).

#### Caution

When using any of these APIs, the underlying cache instance will be **recreated**.
All existing entries will be lost.
Therefore, it is highly recommended to configure the cache **_once_ and _before_** using the `DestinationService` for the first time (e.g. during application start up).

### Change Detection Mode

In case your application typically interacts with more than one destination per tenant, you can significantly improve caching performance by enabling **change detection**:

```java
DestinationService.Cache.enableChangeDetection();
```

The change detection mode will disable the time-based expiration of cached entries.
Instead, when accessing the cache, the implementation checks whether the destination has changed since the last access.
This is done by performing a single HTTP request (per tenant) to fetch **all destination** configurations - this request is cached itself as well and uses the expiration configured via `DestinationService.Cache.setExpiration` (or the default value).
The received configurations are then compared to the cached ones and, if nothing has changed, the cache entry is considered valid.

_Note_:
Destinations that use JWT-based authentication will still be refreshed before the attached JWT expires.

For a single destination (per tenant) this is not a benefit, but for two or more the benefit is **up to 100% per additional destination**.
For example, if your application is interacting with 5 destinations per tenant, you can expect a 3 to 4 times performance increase (i.e. 3 to 4 times less costly HTTP calls).
