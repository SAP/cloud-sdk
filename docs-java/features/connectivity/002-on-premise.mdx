Connecting to On-Premise systems is a crucial part of many enterprise applications.
To make this as easy as possible, the SAP Cloud SDK offers seamless integration with the [SAP BTP Connectivity Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/connectivity) both on [Cloud Foundry](#cloud-foundry-to-on-premise) and [Kubernetes-based environments](#kubernetes-to-on-premise) (e.g. Kyma).

## Cloud Foundry To On-Premise

To enable On-Premise connectivity for applications that are deployed on Cloud Foundry, the SAP Cloud SDK requires **_exactly_ one service binding** to the SAP BTP Connectivity Service.
The information provided within this service binding is then used to [derive the `ProxyAuthorization` header](http-destinations#deriving-the-proxy-authorization-header) for `Destination` objects that use [`ON_PREMISE`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ProxyType.html#ON_PREMISE) as their [`ProxyType`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/HttpDestinationProperties.html#getProxyType()>).

### Principal Propagation

Often times, On-Premise systems do have their own user management, which, in most cases, does not match the user management of Cloud Identity Providers.
This is why tenants and users on the application side need to be exchanged for entities that are registered within the On-Premise system.
This process is called [**_principal propagation_**](https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/configuring-principal-propagation?locale=en-).

The SAP Cloud SDK, therefore, supports the [`PrincipalPropagation` authentication type](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/AuthenticationType.html#PRINCIPAL_PROPAGATION) for On-Premise destinations.
The concrete authentication flow is hereby separated into two parts, which can be configued by setting a property called _`cloudsdk.principalPropagationMode`_ on the `Destination` object.

#### 1. Token Forwarding (Default)

If the _`cloudsdk.principalPropagationMode`_ property is set to `TOKEN_FORWARDING`, or if the property is not set at all, the [`TOKEN_FORWARDING` strategy](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/PrincipalPropagationMode.html#TOKEN_FORWARDING) will be applied.

#### 2. Token Exchange (Discouraged)

:::caution Discouraged

Using the `TOKEN_EXCHANGE` strategy is discouraged as it results in unnecessary roundtrips and is therefore less performant than the `TOKEN_FORWARDING` strategy.

:::

If the _`cloudsdk.principalPropagationMode`_ property is set to `TOKEN_EXCHANGE`, the [`TOKEN_EXCHANGE` strategy](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/PrincipalPropagationMode.html#TOKEN_EXCHANGE) will be applied.

## Kubernetes To On-Premise

The SAP Cloud SDK provides support On-Premise connectivity on Kubernetes-based environments as [documented here](../../environments/kubernetes-kyma#on-premise-connectivity).

## Non-Production Deployment To On-Premise

In non-production environments, such as a developer's local machine or a CI/CD pipeline, the SAP Cloud SDK can still be used to connect to On-Premise systems as [documented here](running-locally).
