Every time before a change of an application is deployed to production, it is crucial to test whether everything is still working as expected.
For that, we need to be able to test and/or run applications in non-productive environments, such as on a developer's machine or in a CI/CD pipeline.

Commonly, applications rely on certain assumptions regarding the runtime environment.
For example, they might assume that certain services are available, or that certain environment variables are set.
Unfortunately, these assumptions are often not met in non-productive environments.

In this article, we will explain different means in the context of connectivity that can help to (unit) test and/or run applications in non-productive environments.

## Testing With `DestinationAccessor`

When using [the `DestinationAccessor` API](btp-destination-service), applications are usually interested in retrieving destinations from the BTP Destination Service.
This functionality, however, assumes that the BTP Destination Service is available (i.e. bound to the application), which is usually not the case when running locally or in a CI/CD pipeline.

Therefore, the SAP Cloud SDK offers several ways to inject destinations into the `DestinationAccessor` API, depending on the concrete use sceanrio.
That way, applications can work even without having access to the BTP Destination Service.

<details>
<summary>Unit Test Example</summary>

In this example, we are going to demonstrate how to use the `DestinationAccessor` API in a unit test.

```java {7-11,14,16-19} showLineNumbers
import io.vavr.control.Try;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.ResourceLock;

@BeforeEach
@AfterEach
void resetDestinationAccessor() {
    DestinationAccessor.setLoader(null);
}

@Test
@ResourceLock("DestinationAccessor")
void testRemoteSystemInteraction() {
    var destination = DefaultHttpDestination.builder("http://my-test-system")
            .authenticationType(AuthenticationType.NO_AUTHENTICATION)
            .build();
    DestinationAccessor.prependDestinationLoader((name, options) -> Try.success(destination));
    // optional sanity check: no matter which name we use, we always get our mocked destination
    assertThat(DestinationAccessor.getDestination("any-name")).isSameAs(destination);

    // TODO: perform actual test
}
```

The code above demonstrates how to easily inject a `Destination` into the `DestinationAccessor` API (line 14).
Please note that we are using the [`prependDestinationLoader` API](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationAccessor.html#prependDestinationLoader(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationLoader)>) to make sure our mocked destination is always returned, no matter which other `DestinationLoader` instances might still be registered.

Additionally, it is very important to remember that the `DestinationAccessor` is based on **static state**. <br />
In other words: Once we are injecting a `Destination` (as in line 14), it will be **used for all subsequent calls** to the `DestinationAccessor` API - even when our initial test is already finished.

Therefore, it is crucial to **reset the `DestinationAccessor`** before **and** after each test (as in lines 3 to 7).
That way, we are avoiding hard-to-debug issues that are only visible when running multiple tests in a specific order.

Furthermore, it is also recommended to use [JUnit5's `@ResourceLock`](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/parallel/ResourceLock.html) when manipulating static state (as in this example).
Using this annotation will prevent our tests from running concurrently, which could lead to unexpected results due to race conditions.

<summary>Local Run Example</summary>

In this example, we are going to demonstrate how to use the `DestinationAccessor` API when running an application locally.
Hereby, we are making use of the [`EnvVarDestinationLoader`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/EnvVarDestinationLoader.html), which converts an environment variable into a `Destination`.
This class is always and automatically available, so that no code changes are required to make the following example work.

First, we need to define our destination configuration like follows:

```shell
export destinations='[{name: "my-destination", url: "https://my-remote-service.com", Authentication: "NoAuthentication" }]'
```

:::caution Limited Authentication Support

Destinations created that way provide support for [`NO_AUTHENTICATION`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/AuthenticationType.html#NO_AUTHENTICATION) and [`BASIC_AUTHENTICATION`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/AuthenticationType.html#BASIC_AUTHENTICATION) only.

:::

In the command above, we are defining a single destination that is called _my-destination_ and points to _https://my-remote-service.com_ using no authentication.
Please note that the `destinations` environment variable is a JSON array, which means that we can define multiple destinations at once.

Once that is done, we can now start our application **in the same shell** (i.e. where the exported environment variable is available). <br />
Now, whenever our application uses `DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination")`, it will receive the destination we defined in the environment variable instead of trying to retrieve it from the BTP Destination Service.

## On-Premise Connectivity From Business Application Studio (BAS)

If you are developing an application in the **Business Application Studio (BAS)**, and want to reach On-Premise systems, perform the following steps:

1. Make sure your BAS instance is part of the same Cloud Foundry space as your Cloud Connector.
1. Add properties `WebIDEEnabled` and `HTML5.DynamicDestination` to your On-Premise destination with the value `true`.
1. In BAS, configure your `destinations` environment variable as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "HTTP",
    "name": "<DESTINATION-NAME>",
    "url": "http://<DESTINATION-NAME>.dest",
    "ProxyHost": "localhost",
    "ProxyPort": 8887
  }
]
```

Please refer to [the BAS connectivity guide](/docs/js/guides/bas) created for the SAP Cloud SDK for JavaScript to get more information and a detailed description of the technical background.
The information there also applies to the SAP Cloud SDK for Java.

## On-Premise Connectivity From Local IDE

The SAP BTP connectivity service builds the connection between SAP BTP and the On-premise network.
That is why it has strong built-in restrictions to allow it only to be called from within the SAP Business Technology Platform.
If you call the connectivity service from your local machine, you will encounter a connection timeout.
We'll therefore apply port forwarding via SSH to simulate that your localhost plays the cloud app.

- Deploy your app to the SAP BTP once.
- Enable SSH access to your app container with the `cf` CLI:

```bash
cf enable-ssh app-name
cf restart app-name
```

- Inspect the value of the entry `connectivity` of your `VCAP_SERVICES` and take note of the values of the fields
  - `credentials.onpremise_proxy_port` (we will refer to the value as _proxy-port_ hereafter)
  - `credentials.onpremise_proxy_host` (we will refer to the value as _proxy-host_ hereafter)

- Create an SSH session to your app container with the following command and let the session opened:

```bash
cf ssh app-name -L proxy-port:proxy-host:proxy-port
```

- Copy over the `VCAP_SERVICES` of your actually deployed app to your local machine so that the app can access it.
  - **Tip** Many IDEs provide support for using the content of a file (e.g. `default-env.json`) as environment variables when starting your application.
    This way, you can avoid the hustle of creating the environment variables yourself.
    Please refer to the documentation of your IDE to learn more about this feature.
- Replace the value of the field `VCAP_SERVICES.connectivity.credentials.onpremise_proxy_host` with `localhost`.
  - That way, the SAP Cloud SDK will use the SSH tunnel instead of the real connectivity service.
