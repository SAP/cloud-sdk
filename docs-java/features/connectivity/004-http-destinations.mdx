HTTP is the most prominent communication protocol supported by the SAP Cloud SDK.
Connecting to a remote system or service using HTTP is, therefore, a very common use case.

The [`HttpDestinationProperties`](pathname:////java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/HttpDestinationProperties.html) interface defines a set of properties that are required to connect to a remote system or service using HTTP, such as the URL, authentication, proxy settings, and HTTP headers.

In the following sections, we are diving into its default, and only, implementation: The [`DefaultHttpDestination`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.html).

## About Immutability

As per API contract, the `DefaultHttpDestination` is an **immutable container** for destination properties.
Once initialized, it is not possible to add, remove, or modify any of its properties.

**However**, there might be properties that contain non-primitive values, such as lists, maps, or other objects.
These values **might** be mutable, depending on their implementation.
Therefore, it is impossible to guarantee _true immutability_ for the `DefaultHttpDestination` implementation.
Instead, the implementation provides a _shallow immutability_ guarantee.

This implementation detail is important for [the following sections](#building-on-top-of-an-existing-destination).

## About HTTP Headers

One of the most important properties of any `HttpDestination` are the HTTP headers, which are attached to any outgoing request performed with the destination.

The `DefaultHttpDestination` implements support for following sources of HTTP headers:

1. Properties named using the pattern `URL.header.<header-name>` will be converted into HTTP headers.
2. [Special properties](#special-header-providers), which will be converted into HTTP headers.
3. Headers that were [directly added](#adding-individual-headers) via the [Builder API](#about-the-builder-api) while assembling the `DefaultHttpDestination` instance.
4. Headers that are provided by [`DestinationHeaderProvider`s](#about-headerproviders).
5. (Conditional) A `Proxy-Authorization` (and potentially a `SAP-Connectivity-SCC-Location_ID`) HTTP header will automatically be added, **iff** the `ProxyType` property is set to `OnPremise` as [explained below](#on-premise-handling).
6. (Conditional) Headers that are dervied from [authentication related properties](#deriving-the-authorization-header), **iff** no `Authorization` header was provided by any of the previous options.
7. (Conditional) Headers that are derived from [proxy authentication related properties](#deriving-the-proxy-authorization-header), **iff** no `Proxy-Authorization` header was provided by any of the previous options.

### On-Premise Handling

The `DefaultHttpDestination` implements dedicated support for on-premise connectivity as [documented here](on-premise).

### Deriving The `Authorization` Header

As [explained above](#about-http-headers), the `DefaultHttpDestination` tries to derive the `Authorization` header from authentication related properties, **iff** no `Authorization` header is provided by any other source.

The concrete properties, hereby, depend on the `AuthenticationType` of the `DefaultHttpDestination`.

- For `AuthenticationType.BASIC_AUTHENTICATION`, the basic credentials are taken from the `User` (or `username`, if the former doesn't exist) and the `Password` properties.

#### Caution

The `DefaultHttpDestination` will throw an exception if the `AuthenticationType` is set to `BASIC_AUTHENTICATION`, but no `User` (or `username`) or `Password` property is provided.

- For `AuthenticationType.TOKEN_FORWARDING`, the `RequestHeaderAccessor` is used to find any `Authorization` header in the current request. All headers that are found (there should usually only be one) is then be forwarded.

### Deriving The `Proxy-Authorization` Header

:::info On-Premise Handling

As described [above](#on-premise-handling), the `DefaultHttpDestination` implements dedicated support for on-premise connectivity.
Therefore, the `Proxy-Authorization` header will automatically be created as [documented here](on-premise) **iff** the `ProxyType` property is set to `ON_PREMISE`.

:::

Similar to [the `Authorization` header](#deriving-the-authorization-header), the `Proxy-Authentication` header is derived from proxy authentication related properties, **iff** no `Proxy-Authentication` header is provided by any other source.

This is done by attempting to transform the value of the `ProxyAuthorization` property as follows:

- If the property doesn't exist or contains an empty `String`, no header is derived.
- If the property contains a `String` that starts with `Basic `, the value is assumed to be a Base64-encoded `username:password` pair and is transformed into a `Basic` header.
- If the property contains a `String` that starts with `Bearer `, the value is assumed to be a JWT token and is transformed into a `Bearer` header.
- Any other value will be **ignored** and no header will be derived. Additionally, an error message will be logged.

#### Caution

The `Proxy-Authorization` header will **only** be derived if the properties contain a full proxy configuration.
Such a proxy configuration must contain a proxy URI, which is either taken from the `Proxy` property or, if that doesn't exist, is constructed from the `ProxyHost` and `ProxyPort` properties.

## About The _Builder_ API

:::danger Expert API

Using the _Builder_ API requires a deep understanding of the `DefaultHttpDestination` implementation.
Therefore, it is considered an _expert API_ and should only be used if absolutely necessary. <br />
We encourage users to rather use [the `DestinationAccessor` API](btp-destination-service) or [the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API](service-bindings) to retrieve destinations.

:::

The [`DefaultHttpDestination.Builder`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.Builder.html) allows you to create a `DefaultHttpDestination` instance from scratch.
It allows you to set any desired property, header, header provider, or any other value that is supported by the `DefaultHttpDestination` implementation.

### Building On Top Of An Existing Destination

Sometimes, you may want to slightly adjust an existing `Destination` instance.
For example, there might be just this one single header missing for a specific request. <br />
Unfortunately, adding this header directly to the existing `Destination` instance is not possible, as [the `Destination` interface is immutable](#about-immutability).

Luckily, the `DefaultHttpDestination` provides a way to create a new `DefaultHttpDestination` instance that is based on an existing `Destination` instance.
This way is implemented in the [`fromDestination(Destination)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.html#fromDestination(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.Destination)>) and [`fromProperties(DestinationProperties)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.html#fromProperties(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationProperties)>) methods.

Both methods will return a new `DefaultHttpDestination.Builder` instance, which is pre-configured with all properties of the given `DestinationProperties`.
If you are using the `fromDestination` method with an instance of `DefaultHttpDestination`, further details will be copied, such as the manually added HTTP headers and `DestinationHeaderProvider`s.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

In the following example, we are retrieving a destination using [the `DestinationAccessor` API](btp-destination-service).

We would like to add a new header to the destination, but we don't want to lose any of the existing headers.
Therefore, we are using the `DefaultHttpDestination#fromDestination` method like so:

```java
Destination existingDestination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("my-destination");
assertThat(existingDestination.asHttp().getHeaders())
        .containsExactly(
                new Header("X-My-Header", "MyHeaderValue")
        );

DefaultHttpDestination enhancedDestination = DefaultHttpDestination.fromDestination(existingDestination)
        .header(new Header("My-New-Header", "MyNewHeaderValue"))
        .build();

assertThat(enhancedDestination.getHeaders())
        .containsExactly(
                new Header("X-My-Header", "MyHeaderValue"),
                new Header("My-New-Header", "MyNewHeaderValue")
        );
```

As a result, our `enhancedDestination` will contain all headers from the `existingDestination` and the new `My-New-Header` header.

#### Caution

Please note the behavior of [adding individual headers](#adding-individual-headers) and [adding individual header providers](#adding-individual-header-providers).
Also, pay attention to [potentially shared state](#about-immutability) between the `existingDestination` and the `enhancedDestination`.

### Adding Individual Headers

Individual headers can be added via the [`header(Header)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.Builder.html#header(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.Header)>) and [`header(String, String)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.Builder.html#header(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)>) methods.
In either case, the newly added header is **only added** to the list of all headers.
It will **not** override any existing header with the same name.

### Adding Individual Header Providers

The [`headerProviders(DestinationHeaderProvider...)`](<pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DefaultHttpDestination.Builder.html#headerProviders(com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationHeaderProvider...)>) method allows you to add as many `DestinationHeaderProvider`s to the `DefaultHttpDestination` instance as you wish.
Once again, existing header providers will **not** be overridden.

### Adding Static Header Providers

In some scenarios, there are certain HTTP headers that should always be sent to a destination, regardless of the request.

Adding these headers to each and every `DefaultHttpDestination` is not only cumbersome but also error-prone.
So instead of doing that, the `DefaultHttpDestination` uses the _Service Locator Pattern_ to find `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementations on the classpath and adds them automatically.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

Lets assume you would like to always send a special `X-My-Header` header to all remote systems your application is communicating with.

To do so, you would first create a `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementation that adds the header to any destination:

```java
package com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.example;

class MyHeaderProvider implements DestinationHeaderProvider {
    @Nonnull
    @Override
    public List<Header> getHeaders(@Nonnull DestinationRequestContext requestContext) {
        return Collections.singletonList(new Header("X-My-Header", "MyHeaderValue"));
    }
}
```

The above code is as simple as it gets.
It will always add a static value (`"MyHeaderValue"`) to every `DefaultHttpDestination`.

Of course, in a real application, the logic might be a bit more complex.
To cope with that, the `DestinationRequestContext` provides access to the current request URI and the destination.
That way, you could implement a more complex logic that adds different values to different destinations or decides to not add any headers, if some special condition is met.

Lastly, you would still need to make use of the _Service Locator Pattern_ to register your `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementation. <br />
For that, you need to create a file called `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationHeaderProvider` in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/services` folder of your application.
This file must contain the fully qualified name of your `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementation. <br />
In this example, the content shoulld be `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.example.MyHeaderProvider`.

The result should look like this:

```
(your application root)
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        └── java
            ├── com
            │ ... (truncated)
            └── resources
                └── META-INF
                    └── services
                        └── com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationHeaderProvider
```

</details>

### Using mTLS

The `DefaultHttpDestination` can be configured to use the [BTP CF Instance Identity](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/instance-identity.html) by using [`SecurityConfigurationStrategy.FROM_PLATFORM`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/SecurityConfigurationStrategy.html#FROM_PLATFORM). <br />
[`SecurityConfigurationStrategy.FROM_DESTINATION`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/SecurityConfigurationStrategy.html#FROM_DESTINATION), on the other hand, derives the security configuration from the destination properties.

## About _HeaderProviders_

A [`DestinationHeaderProvider`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/DestinationHeaderProvider.html) is a simple, yet powerful way of adding HTTP headers to a `DefaultHttpDestination`.

The interface defines just a single method:

```java
List<Header> getHeaders( DestinationRequestContext requestContext );
```

If attached to a `DefaultHttpDestination`, this method will be called whenever the `DefaultHttpDestination` is collecting its HTTP headers (i.e. whenever the `DefaultHttpDestination#getHeaders()` method is called).

The `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementation hereby gets an instance of `DestinationRequestContext`, which provides access to the current request URI and the destination.
Thus, the implementation gets full access to all properties of the calling `DefaultHttpDestination` instance and can, therefore, decide whether and which HTTP headers it wants to add.

:::danger Infinite Loop

Calling the `HttpDestination#getHeaders()` method within a `DestinationHeaderProvider` implementation will result in an infinite loop and, therefore, a `StackOverflowError`.

:::

### Special Header Providers

The SAP Cloud SDK comes with a set of `DestinationHeaderProvider`s that are automatically added to any `DefaultHttpDestination` instance.

The [`ErpDestinationHeaderProvider`](pathname:///java-api/v5/com/sap/cloud/sdk/cloudplatform/connectivity/ErpDestinationHeaderProvider.html) is part of the [`cloudplatform-connectivity` artifact](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/cloudplatform-connectivity) and, therefore, will **always** be added to any `DefaultHttpDestination` instance. <br />
It provides the following headers:

- The `sap-client` header, **iff** the `DefaultHttpDestination` contains a `sap-client` property.
- The `sap-language` header.
  - If the `DefaultHttpDestination` contains a property called `cloudsdk.dynamicSapLanguage` with value `true`, the `LocaleAccessor` will be used to determine the current locale.
  - Otherwise, if there is a `sap-language` property, its value will be used.
