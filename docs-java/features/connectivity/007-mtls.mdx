:::note

This article talks about using mTLS to connect with cloud services like `XSUAA` or `Destination` service.
If you are interested in using mTLS for communication between your application and target destination, please refer [here](/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/destination-service#enabling-mtls-for-application-to-destination-communication) instead.

:::

The SAP Cloud SDK supports certificate-based authentication while establishing connections to other cloud services like `XSUAA` or `Destination` service.

## Why Certificate-Based Authentication (mTLS)

Mutual `TLS` or `mTLS` for short is a method for mutual authentication.
It ensures that before proceeding with the `HTTP` exchange both the client and the server each mutually verify each other's identities by the use of `X.509` certificates.
Using certificate-based authentication ensures overcoming the shortcomings of authenticating with `clientsecret`.

## Shortcomings of Using Secret for Token Retrieval

Let's take an example of a service or an application protected by [`XSUAA`](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/6373bb7a96114d619bfdfdc6f505d1b9.html).
To access the service or application, you'll need a `JWT`.
You will usually fetch a `JWT` by providing `clientid`, `clientsecret` and `uri` stored in your service binding to run a [`token retrieval flow`](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/main/token-client) say for e.g. `client`

The use of `clientsecret` has an inherent risk of these credentials being leaked, especially as they are not frequently rotated.
Leaking these credentials into the hands of an attacker can cause a lot of harm and stay long unnoticed.
The use of certificate-based authentication to fetch the `JWT` from `XSUAA` significantly reduces the risk of leaking secrets and makes rotating them easier.

:::note

The SAP Cloud SDK automatically

- Fetches the `JWT` for you
- Adds the fetched `JWT` to the `Authorization` header when requesting a service to ensure that the request gets authenticated and authorized.

Application developers do not need to worry about doing any of this themselves.

:::

## Certificate-Based Authentication for Services

To adhere to the latest recommended security best practices by SAP, some re-use and kernel services have enabled certificate-based authentication.
As a consequence, SAP Cloud SDK also supports certificate-based authentication while accessing these services.
If a service binding has a property `credentials: { credential-type: x509 }` then this is an indication that you can use certificate-based authentication to access the service.

`XSUAA` service is one of the services that has enabled certificate-based authentication.
This means that in the service binding in addition to the `client_secret` you will also find `certificate` and `key` entries now.
Example:

```json
{
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
		"xsuaa": [
			{
				"label": "xsuaa",
				...
				"credentials": {
				    ...
				    "credential-type": "x509"
					"clientid": "fictional-client-id",
					"clientsecret": "fictional-secret",
					"certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----fictional-certificate-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
					"key": "key"
					...
				},
			}
		]
	}
}
```

This certificate would now be used in place of `clientsecret` to obtain the `JWT` using [`XSUAA` token retrieval flows](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-security-xsuaa-integration/tree/main/token-client).
The SAP Cloud SDK will as before fetch the `JWT` for you.
The only difference is that the `certificate` from your service binding is used to authenticate the client.

## Default Validity Period of Certificates

The `X.509` certificates used in the service binding could either be external or `XSUAA` managed.
By default `XSUAA` managed certificates are valid only for **7 days**.
Your calls to the `XSUAA` to fetch a `JWT` will fail after your certificate expires.

You can verify this by looking at the logs of your application, you should see

```
[APP/PROC/WEB/0] OUT Caused by: com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.security.exception.TokenRequestFailedException:
com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa.tokenflows.TokenFlowException:
Error requesting technical user token with grant_type 'client_credentials':
Error retrieving JWT token. Server URI https://<subdomain>.authentication.cert.<landscape domain>/oauth/token.
Http status code 400. Response body '400 Bad Request: TLS handshake failed.

[APP/PROC/WEB/0] OUT ssl_c_err: X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED
```

Don't get confused with the grant_type of `client_credentials` in the log, this is expected.

For `X.509` certificate-based authentication, the token retrieval end point will look like
`https://<subdomain>.authentication.cert.<landscape domain>/oauth/token`.
Notice that the endpoint contains **cert** .

For authentication based on `clientsecret`, the end point would have looked like: `https://<subdomain>.authentication.<landscape domain>/oauth/token`

:::caution certificate renewal process

To obtain a new certificate, you will have to delete and re-create a service binding.
The application also needs to be restarted to use the updated service binding.

:::

### Extending the Validity of a Certificate

For less frequent certificate rotation you can extend its validity to a maximum of 1 year.
For the `XSUAA` managed certificate use parameters below while creating a service **binding**.

`cf bind-service myapp myservice -c parameters.json`

```json
{
  "credential-type": "x509",
  "x509": {
    "key-length": 2048,
    "validity": 365,
    "validity-type": "DAYS"
  }
}
```

:::note

With longer certificate validity there is a danger that compromised certificate might go unnoticed for a significant period of time.
This significantly increases potential damage to a compromised system.

:::

### Sticking to Using Secret for Token Retrieval

If you prefer to continue using **clientSecret** instead of **Certificate-based Authentication**, make sure your `xs-security.json` contains the `instance-secret` as the first entry in the property `credential-types`.

```json
"oauth2-configuration": {
  "credential-types": ["instance-secret"]
}
```

## Using Automated Certificate Rotation using the Zero Trust Identity Service (SAP-internal)

For SAP-internal development teams the Zero Trust Identity Service (ZTIS) provides a way to automate the certificate rotation process.

### Configuring your Application to use ZTIS

This guide covers how you can configure and use the SAP Cloud SDK to use certificates provided by ZTIS for certificate-based authentication.

:::note Prerequisites for using ZTIS

The following prerequisites are required to use ZTIS:

- You have assigned the required entitlement for using ZTIS to your subaccount.
- You have created a service instance of `zero-trust-identity`.
- You have bound the ZTIS service instance to your application.
- For Cloud Foundry: You have added the `zero_trust_sidecar_buildpack` as an additional buildpack for your application.
- For Kubernetes (Kyma, Gardener): 
    - You have installed the [ZTIS Operator](https://github.tools.sap/pse/ztis-operator?tab=readme-ov-file) in your cluster.
       - On Kyma, this is available as the [ZTIS Agent Kyma Module](https://pages.github.tools.sap/pse/pse-docs/docs/identity-k8s/references/ztis-agent-kyma-module).
    - Your application has the [`SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` environment variable](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_Endpoint.md#4-locating-the-endpoint) set, pointing to the workload attestation API of the ZTIS agent.

Head over to the [official documentation](https://pages.github.tools.sap/pse/pse-docs/docs/identity/), the [reference manual](https://github.tools.sap/pse/blueprints/blob/main/examples/cf/ZTIS_Reference.md) and [sample code](https://github.tools.sap/pse/blueprints/tree/main/examples/cf/java/ztis-identity/cf-manifest) to learn more about how to use ZTIS.

:::

To enable support by SAP Cloud SDK for certificates provided by ZTIS in your application, you need to add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform</groupId>
	<artifactId>connectivity-ztis</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Integration with SAP BTP Services

The SAP Cloud SDK supports using certificates provided by ZTIS to authenticate to SAP BTP services.
For example:

- Identity Authentication Service (IAS)
- Authorization and Trust Management Service (XSUAA)
- Destination Service, Connectivity Service, etc.


The SAP Cloud SDK automatically recognizes the credential type `X509_ATTESTED` and uses the certificates provided by ZTIS in that case.
Consequently, any BTP service supporting this credential type can be accessed using ZTIS.
For more details please refer to the documentation on [connecting to services](/docs/java/features/connectivity/service-bindings).

### Connecting to other Systems using Destinations

Aside from connecting to SAP BTP services, you can also obtain or enhance any `HttpDestination` to use the certificate provided by ZTIS.

```java
var ks = ZeroTrustIdentityService.getInstance().getOrCreateKeyStore();

// create a new destination
var newDestination = DefaultHttpDestination.builder("https://foo.com")
	.keyStore(ks)
	.build();

// enhance an existing destination, e.g. from BTP destination service
var existingDestination = DestinationAccessor.getDestination("myDestination");
var enhancedDestination = DefaultHttpDestination.fromDestination(existingDestination)
	.keyStore(ks)
	.build();
```

### Developing Locally

On Cloud Foundry the `zero_trust_sidecar_buildpack` adds a sidecar to your application that fetches the certificates from ZTIS.
When developing locally this sidecar is usually not available.

To develop locally you can instead store the certificate and key on your local file system.
Download the certificate and key from a running instance of your application on Cloud Foundry via `cf ssh`:

```shell
cf ssh <app-name> -c "/home/vcap/deps/0/bin/spire-agent api fetch -socketPath /tmp/spire-agent/public/api.sock -write /tmp/"
cf ssh <app-name> -c "cat /tmp/svid.0.pem" > /path/to/certificate.pem
cf ssh <app-name> -c "cat /tmp/svid.0.key" > /path/to/key.key
```

You then need to provide the paths to the certificate and key with a service binding locally.

For example, you can locally create the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable with the following content:

```json
{
  "zero-trust-identity": [
    {
      "label": "zero-trust-identity",
      "credentials": {
        "certPath": "/path/to/certificate.pem",
        "keyPath": "/path/to/key.key"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the service binding programmatically:

```java
new DefaultServiceBindingBuilder()
	.withServiceIdentifier(ZTIS_IDENTIFIER)
	.withCredentials(Map.of(
            "certPath", "/path/to/certificate.pem",
            "keyPath", "/path/to/key.key"))
	.build();

// in case you only need this one service binding the following code is fine:
DefaultServiceBindingAccessor.setInstance(() -> List.of(binding));
```

You can read more about how to create service bindings for local development [here](/docs/java/features/connectivity/service-bindings#local-development).
