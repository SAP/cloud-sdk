## OpenAPI Based Type-Safe Client for RESTful Services in Java

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard is a popular format to define RESTful APIs.
Together with [OData](../odata/overview.mdx) it is one of the key API definition formats used at SAP.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient tooling to make the consumption of OpenAPI services easy and convenient.
We provide a customized [OpenAPI code generator](generate-rest-client.mdx) capable of converting an OpenAPI specification into a type-safe Java client library nicely integrated with the SAP Business Technology Platform abstractions also provided by the SAP Cloud SDK.
You can use that generator to create a client for an OpenAPI-based API of your choice.
To speed up things for developers and reduce maintenance, we are working with different SAP services to release pregenerated client libraries available through [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*).
Another way to get a client library is to generate it yourself based on API specifications available at [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/).
If you encounter any problems or errors with OpenAPI tooling give us feedback via our [support channels](/docs/overview/get-support).

### Pregenerated Type-Safe OpenAPI Client

We ship pregenerated type-safe OpenAPI client libraries as modules in collaboration with popular SAP services available on SAP Business Technology Platform and beyond.

Depending on the scope, modules could be available only internally within SAP or publicly released.
The [SAP Workflow service](clients/scp-workflow-rest-api) is an example of a publicly released API module.
