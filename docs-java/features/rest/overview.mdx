## OpenAPI Based Type-Safe Client for RESTful Services in Java

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard is a popular format to define RESTful APIs.
Together with [OData](../odata/overview.mdx) it is one of the key API definition formats used at SAP.
The SAP Cloud SDK provides convenient tooling to make the consumption of OpenAPI services easy and convenient.
We provide a customized [OpenAPI code generator](generate-rest-client.mdx) capable of converting an OpenAPI specification into a type-safe Java client library nicely integrated with the SAP Business Technology Platform abstractions also provided by the SAP Cloud SDK.
You can use that generator to create a client for an OpenAPI-based API of your choice.
Specifications are available at [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/).
If you encounter any problems or errors with OpenAPI tooling give us feedback via our [support channels](/docs/overview/get-support).
