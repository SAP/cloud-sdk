### _"How to add a custom header to AI Core requests?"_

The AI SDK leverages the destination concept from the SAP Cloud SDK for AI to manage the connection to AI Core.
This opens up a wide range of possibilities to customize the connection, including adding custom headers.

```java
var service = new AiCoreService();
var destination =
    DefaultHttpDestination.fromDestination(service.getBaseDestination())
        .header("my-header-key", "my-header-value")
        .build();

// AI Core client
service = service.withBaseDestination(destination);
DeploymentApi client = new DeploymentApi(service);

// Orchestration client
OrchestrationClient client = new OrchestrationClient(destination);

// OpenAI client
OpenAiClient client2 = OpenAiClient.withCustomDestination(destination);
```

For more information, please refer to the [AI Core connectivity guide](./guides/connecting-to-ai-core) and the [SAP Cloud SDK for AI documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/features/connectivity/http-destinations).

### _"There's a vulnerability warning `CVE-2021-41251`?"_

This is a known false-positive finding.
Depending on the tooling any product called "SAP Cloud SDK for AI" or similar with a low version number may be marked as vulnerable, incorrectly.
Please consider suppressing the warning, [as we do](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java/blob/main/.pipeline/dependency-check-suppression.xml).
