## 4.0.0 - October 12, 2022

[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.sdk*%20AND%20v:4.0.0)

### Improvements

This is the first release of the SAP Cloud SDK version 4.
As this is a new major version, this release contains a lot of (under the hood) improvements, refactorings, and other changes.
Please refer to the [Upgrade Guide](./guides/4.0-upgrade) for details instructions on how to upgrade your SAP Cloud SDK dependecy to our new major version and for a detailed list of changes.

### Compatibility Notes

- We are aware of the vulnerability [CVE-2022-42003](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42003), which affects a version of `jackson-databind` that is shipped as part of the `sdk-bom`.
  After careful investigation we found that the described exploit **does not** affect the SAP Cloud SDK.
  Nevertheless, customers should be aware of this vulnerability and check their code.

  We will update the affected dependency as soon as a production ready fix is available.

### Known issues

- We are aware of a version conflict of the `com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding:*` dependencies when the SAP Cloud SDK is used in combination with CAP ([`cds-integration-cloud-sdk`](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cds%20AND%20a:cds-integration-cloud-sdk)).
  This conflict can be resolved by including following dependency in the `<dependencyManagement>` section of your project:

  ```xml
<!-- Service Binding Library -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-modules-bom</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
  ```

  ```xml

      <dependencies>

          <!-- CDS SERVICES -->

              <artifactId>cds-services-bom</artifactId>
              <version>${cds.services.version}</version>
              <type>pom</type>
              <scope>import</scope>
          </dependency>
