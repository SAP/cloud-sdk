Let us imaging you're building an app in the SAP Business Technology Platform.
Your app calls OData v4 APIs from one or many SAP services exposed by SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud for Customer, and others.
OData v4 is a complex protocol based on REST that has a pretty steep learning curve.
Every service is unique and can choose what API features to expose.
You can shorten your path to success by leveraging a type-safe OData v4 client from the SAP Cloud SDK for Java and discover available APIs directly from your IDE.

To simplify it, we recorded this Community Call session about using a type-safe client for Java.
Enjoy the hands-on experience delivered by SAP Cloud SDK developers!
