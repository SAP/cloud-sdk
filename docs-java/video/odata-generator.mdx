Imagine you need to develop an app that integrates with an OData service.
Maybe you also want to host it on SAP Business Technology Platform?
This might be a painstaking task.
This video tutorial shows how to minimize your efforts and simplify everything to the limit.
All you have to do is use SAP Cloud SDK for Java and have your hands on an API definition which is usually the `EDMX` file.
In case you have access to your service, the simplest way to get it is by using the `/$metadata` endpoint and saving it to a file.

In this video, the SAP developers' advocate [Max Streifeneder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkzNZP9fzLxRyhnGT2ziSRw) will take you step-by-step to success.
