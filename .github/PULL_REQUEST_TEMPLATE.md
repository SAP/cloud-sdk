## Manual Checks?

- [ ] Text adheres to the style guide (`vale docs/`)
  - Every sentence is on its own line
  - Headings use [title capitalization](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/AP/#) (applies also to the sidebar and title of a document)
  - You followed [naming center](https://www.sapbrandtools.com/naming-center/#/dashboard) guidelines when referring to SAP products (e.g. SAP S/4HANA)
- [ ] You checked your spelling and grammar (consider using Grammarly, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- [ ] You formatted all changed files with lint and prettier (`npm run lint:fix`)
- [ ] You tested if the documentation still builds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] You verified all new and changed links still work (changing the `id` or name of a file can break links)
- [ ] You have updated the [feature matrix](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk/blob/main/docs/components/data/features.js) if you add documentation on a new feature or otherwise required.
